Graduate student MA and PhD theses are collected by the University and deposited in an institutional repository. Major research essays, and major research projects are not. MREs and MRPs are, more and more each year, also accompanied by substantial digital projects. These will be gathered here as well. This is a project of the Department of History's Communications Committee.

## Intentions for this site

Aside from merely providing access to the wealth of graduate research conducted over the years, we intend to build thematic pages to showcase various themes in our research, and the various modalities that students use to _do_ their work. For example:

{% include feature/image.html objectid="hist_60" width="50" caption="Kathryn Boschmann's work combined oral histories with a compelling website" %}

{% include feature/card.html header="Oral Histories" text="Kathryn Boschmann's work combined oral histories with a compelling website " objectid="hist_60" width="25" centered=true %}

{% include feature/card.html header="Maps and Soundscapes" text="Rob Blades used geolocated soundscapes to tell industrial history " objectid="hist_317" width="25" centered=true %}

{% include feature/card.html header="Richly Annotated Scholarly Editions" text="Kaitlyn Brasseur built a scholarly edition of medieval texts held by Carleton's MacOdrum Library " objectid="hist_15" width="25" align=right %}

{% include feature/card.html header="Immersive Engagement" text="Jenna Emslie designed a video game to immerse the player in the world of Ontario's Gold Fields " objectid="hist_339" width="25" align=left %}

Dig into our students' research. You never know what you might find!

## Themes in Student Research

We will also be looking at themes in student research over the years since 1958, the earliest thesis in the collection. The image below for instance is a topic model of theses produced over the last decade, showing where our students' interests lie, and how they change over time. We currently have full text abstracts for theses from 2001 onwards on this site; abstracts for MREs and MRPs will be added in due course.
