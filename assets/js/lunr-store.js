Approximately 3,700 of these auxiliaries participated in, and carried out, systemic violence against Nazi concentration camp victims. The female overseers who worked in the Nazi camps consisted of a diverse group of \"ordinary\" women from various backgrounds and individual identity. Post-war discussions established a narrative of 'masculinity' and 'deviancy' surrounding the Aufseherinnen that continues within current public memory. Examining Holocaust photographs taken by Nazi concentration camp staff and Allied liberation troops this thesis expands current knowledge on the workaday lives of female SS guards (Aufseherinnen).","subject": "European History","location": "Germany",

The thesis will start with exploring and defining its theoretical understanding of historical narratives and procedural rhetoric. Then, the thesis will continue with how other scholars have discussed the role of and potential that games have in the imparting of historical knowledge. Using this established methodology and theory of game-based learning, this thesis will analyze three historical board games for their ability to impart historical understanding. After the analysis of the three case studies this thesis will showcase an annotated version of the rules for the historical board game: Divided Kingdom, 561 which was created for this thesis. In the annotated rulebook, and design journal that follows it, the author elaborates on the game's intention as a pedagogical tool and how it is designed to communicate historical understanding of sixth century Frankish Gaul.","subject": "Medieval; Education","location": "France",

Blaming the foreign press, the Nationalists established a program of propaganda aimed at addressing the issue. Canada was one of nine countries targeted by South Africa's Information Service from 1949. This thesis illustrates the efforts of the Service, operating under the South African Department of Foreign Affairs, to change the narrative of Canadian newspapers about South Africa, and the reaction of the Canadian journalists to those efforts. It examines how the Service, from its inception until the events following Sharpeville in 1960, confronted journalists at Canada's progressive English language newspapers, and moved against Norman Phillips, a Canadian foreign correspondent reporting from South Africa.","subject": "Canadian History;African History","location": "South Africa",

Mary's letters have gone largely unexamined by scholars, despite the new interest in the writing of women in the early modern period. On her letters she used appeals to kinship, emphasis on rank, calls to shared religion and expressions of emotion in order to support specific objectives for her letters. The flexibility and variety of the rhetoric contained within the letters from across her life show Mary to be an accomplished and competent rhetorician. The epistolary exchanges examined in this thesis were essential in maintaining Mary's diplomatic networks both during her reign and after her abdication. The letters examined in this thesis come from both published collections of Mary's letters from the nineteenth century and from original transcriptions of archival material of letters than have not been previously published or examined.","subject": "European History; Rhetoric and Composition; Gender Studies","location": "Scotland",

"title": "A Catholic Woman and a Catholic Queen: The Personal Religiosity of Mary Tudor","date": "2021","creator": "Newman, Meghan","description": "This thesis provides a detailed analysis of the identifiable aspects of Mary Tudor's personal religious beliefs and practices from childhood to the end of her reign. It carefully examines a variety of evidence including translations done by Mary, book and manuscript dedications written by and to Mary, correspondence, first-hand accounts, Mary's privy purse expenses, her will, and Marian acts and proclamations. This analysis puts Mary's personal religiosity in conversation with her religious policy as queen. Mary demonstrated pious dedication to the Mass and other traditionally Catholic liturgical elements and nearly unwavering dedication to Rome and the papacy. During her reign Mary and her government promoted a religious policy that was consistent with core aspects of Mary's personal religiosity. This thesis concludes that Mary was not only theologically Catholic and dedicated to the traditional liturgical rites, like her father Henry VIII, but also dedicated to England's ecclesiastical relationship with Rome.","subject": "European History; History of Religion","location": "England",

By integrating psychological, psychiatric and psychoanalytical textbooks into several programs after the Second World War, the University of Toronto became a unique source of local accreditation for these disciplines' professed knowledge about homosexuality. Clinical education at the university's medical school similarly modelled racist and ableist intake procedures ostensibly evaluating specific homosexuals' capacity to benefit from psychoanalysis. This, coupled with the extensive circulation of psy-disciplinary discourse among students, demonstrates the University of Toronto's local influence as a site of legitimation for medicalized, 'rehabilitative' authority over marginalized communities. This approach would consistently be considered progressive and effective by university-educated, middle-class Canadians throughout the 1940s-1970s. The extensive embrace of 'rehabilitative' ideals in postwar Canada would impact both state violence and the resistance strategies of activist organizations like the University of Toronto Homophile Association.","subject": "Canadian History; Education - History of; History of Science","location": "Canada",

Set in the context of a public history theatrical experiment, this study investigates local and community memories pertaining to Sudbury mining strikes in the postwar period from 1958 through to 2010. Archival research and oral history interviews were conducted on major labour strikes in this era and that research was used to script, rehearse, and stage a theatrical play. Interviews with audience members and performers were also conducted at all stages of the process. This process allows the dissertation to consider the perspectives of both performers and audience members, each enacting their roles as producers and consumers of public history. The dissertation also assesses the value of this form of history making, as it relates to the formation of historical consciousness, both then and now, of individuals within the Sudbury community. This study argues that public history as theatre has the potential to provide an effective and affecting means to nurture critical, reflexive historical consciousness both on and off the stage.","subject": "Canadian History; Theater; Public history","location": "Canada;Sudbury",

"title": "Lest We Commemorate: Assembling Canadas Great War Centenary, 2014-2018","date": "2021","creator": "Lester, Breanna Theresa","description": "This dissertation studies the commemorative practices of the centenary of the First World War (2014-2018). The centenary occurred within a decade-long commemorative period known as the \"Road to 2017\" (2010-2017) that was itself dedicated to marking the 150th anniversary of Confederation. While participating in commemorations, particularly federally sanctioned ones, is socially and culturally constructed an act of good citizenship, these elements have resulted in scholarship that focusses on nation, nationalism, and collective memory. In contrast, with its focus on practices this dissertation approaches commemoration as labour and its practitioners as history workers. To do so, the dissertation applies assemblage theory and a wide range of methodologies to an archive of Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) records, interviews with commemoration professionals inside and outside of government, media, and autoethnographic observations. It explores how battlefields were assembled into commemorative landscapes and recognizes both the human and non-human agency involved in those processes. The dissertation then focusses acutely on the day-to-day bureaucratic work involved with designing, enacting, and managing centenary events and practices, and considers the affective nature of that labour on the people who did it. Throughout the chapters, interviews and ATIP records provide unique perspective from inside the various bureaucratic and commemorative assemblages that intersected during the First World War centenary, while autoethnographic fieldwork reveals some of the hidden and unexpected elements of commemorative experiences. This dissertation argues that more scholarly attention should be paid to the practical and logistical components of commemoration. To do so means to better understand what makes commemorations affective, including why accessible and operating toilets can be as important as navigating the political nuances of which flags to display in what order at a centenary ceremony. An attention to practice, furthermore, also makes possible a more generous, empathetic appreciation of a group of often-invisible history workers who, despite often stressful working conditions, sacrificed aspects of their personal lives and wellbeing to execute the important large-scale events that comprised the Canadian centenary experience.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada",

The subjective choices present in the graphic narrative, titled No Place for Women, erodes the dichotomy between \"fictional\" and \"factual\" storytelling, and advocates for the validity of graphic mediums to represent historical narratives. In doing so it contributes to the visual representation of the Crimean War and gives scholarly attention to the often overlooked wives of British officers who accompanied their husbands to Crimea. By regarding Fanny as a \"worthy\" historical subject this project dispels the patriarchal power structures that oversimplify and obscure our ability to understand the Crimean War. It also provides a preliminary methodological framework for historians interested in alternative narrative structures. Finally, it argues for the fundamental recasting of terms and standards historians use to qualify objective, neutral, and universal history.","subject": "European History","location": "Britain",

"title": "Deaf Education, the Politics of Humanitarianism, and State Formation in Saskatchewan and Alberta, 1880-1931","date": "2021","creator": "Barron, Sandy","description": "This study traces the development of deaf education in Alberta and Saskatchewan between 1880 and 1931 and its corresponding effects on state formation in Western Canada. Through this topic, it identifies a rise of deaf politics in the wake of the First World War that achieved notable successes in Saskatchewan in the interwar period. A new term for discussing oppressive attitudes against deaf communities from hearing people, humanitarianism, is proposed and explored. These provinces took decades to develop state institutions that were meant to ensure \"productive\" and \"independent\" futures for deaf children in the burgeoning nineteenth-century liberal colonial order on the Prairies. In doing so, they began to define their own provincial boundaries, both in the sense of geography and responsibility. They also began to define theoretical boundaries between deafness and hearing, intellectual ability and disability, as well as rights and humanitarian assistance. The development of deaf education in Alberta and Saskatchewan, I argue, pushed emergent provinces to accept the rights of deaf youth to education, though this process was uneven and did not represent a straight teleological arch. Deaf associations and individuals themselves pushed the provinces and took leadership roles in this process, making them heretofore unrecognized political agents in search of rights. Chapters include considerations of deaf education as an instrument of settler colonialism, histories of hearing and deaf families with deaf children, the role played by the Manitoba School for the Deaf in marking intellectual disability in the three Prairie provinces, and the role of the Western Canadian Association of the Deaf in the founding of the Saskatchewan School for the Deaf in 1931.","subject": "Education - History of;Canadian History","location": "Alberta;Saskatchewan;Canada",

This reduces scholastic understanding of Soviet activity in Africa and Africa's role as a theatre in a truly global Cold War. This thesis is not a survey of Soviet interactions with African partners, but an investigation of trends in Soviet policy towards Africa that become evident with a wider lens. This approach places Soviet activity in a continental and global perspective. This project focuses specifically on the post-Stalin era between 1953 and 1991. While Soviet leaders hesitantly collaborated to defeat the United States and its allies in what the Soviets considered a zero-sum game, this project concludes there was no grand plan towards Africa.

Cut off from their homeland and families by both geographic distance and physical enclosure, letters provided women religious with a medium to ensure their convents' survival and preserve English Catholicism. This critical analysis of nuns' letters reveals the multidimensional nature and intentional construction of their correspondence. Nuns made deliberate epistolary choices. They employed strategic language, utilized flattery and humility, as well as exaggeration and gossip to achieve their objectives. A comparison of individual epistolary experiences demonstrates that letters were vital for maintaining familial and kinship ties, financial and spiritual economies, political engagement, and the transnational diffusion of information.","subject": "European History; Women's Studies; History of Religion","location": "England;Europe",

"title": "Object Lessons: Domestic Interiors on Display at Eatons Toronto Department Stores","date": "2020","creator": "Haight, Susan","description": "During the interwar years the T. Eaton Company constructed a number of life-sized model houses and period rooms in their Toronto department stores as a means of marketing furniture and house furnishings. This thesis argues that Eaton's used these domestic displays in a program of public pedagogy intended to sell Torontonians specific ideas about middle class values as well as tables and chairs, carpets and wallpaper. Advertising, most notably in the Toronto Globe, complemented these object lessons in modern middlebrow domesticity. Starting in the late nineteenth century many furniture retailers in Europe and North America had deployed such displays as marketing tools. Situating this commercial practice in a particular time and place enables a deeper understanding of its cultural meaning. Eaton's interwar displays reflected corporate imaginings of the local market: Thrift House (1926-1950) was designed to appeal to budget-conscious homeowners, while the Ideal Ontario House (1930-1936) encouraged more affluent Torontonians to buy Canadian made furnishings. The House of To-day (1929) targeted those willing to experiment with innovative art moderne designs. Period interiors featuring English and French historical styles remained a constant, reflecting the popularity of tradition during these decades. Mid level employees, such as interior designers René Cera and Phyllis Stagg, and innovative copywriter Edith Macdonald (known as 'The Scribe'), used their talents to teach shoppers about the aesthetics of interior design, financial literacy, and the impact of consumer choices on the national economy: a syllabus that reinforced a definition of appropriate middle class consumerism as disciplined desire. As a site of display, Eaton's was linked to more obviously authoritative institutions of public pedagogy in Toronto, such as the Royal Ontario Museum. Through its focus on domesticity and its embrace of public pedagogy as a key marketing technique, the store cultivated an image as a civic benefactor, undercutting contemporary critiques of mass merchandising as essentially deceptive and corrupt. Case studies of the store's interwar domestic displays reveal successes and failures of Eaton's bid for cultural authority in a city of homes.","subject": "Canadian History; Design and Decorative Arts","location": "Canada;Ontario;Toronto",

"title": "The Course and Canon of Left Nationalism in English Canada, 1968-1979","date": "2020","creator": "Chiarello, Michael Cesare","description": "This dissertation is an inquiry into the political and intellectual currents of English Canadian left nationalism from the late 1960s through the 1970s. It investigates the reasons why left nationalism emerged as a major force in English Canadian left politics and explores the evolution of a neo-Marxist critique of both Canadian capitalism and Canada's relationship with the United States. Left nationalism represented a distinctive perspective and political agenda. Its vision was of a Canada divorced from the American-led capitalist world system. English Canadian left nationalism had a political manifestation in the Waffle movement and an intellectual manifestation in the New Canadian Political Economy. The dissertation demonstrates that the left nationalist interpretation of Canadian-American relations was not rooted in anti-Americanism, but in a radical politics of democratic socialism and anti-imperialism. Left nationalism was primarily the product of neo-Marxist thought, rather than a reaction to problems in American politics, society, and foreign policy. English Canadian left nationalists were disruptors who, unlike their New Nationalist contemporaries, did not advance a program of capitalist or social democratic reform. The left nationalists were determined to replace capitalism with democratic socialism; without socialism, there could be no Canadian independence. Left nationalists sought to end Canada's colonial status in the declining American empire, viewed the preservation of Canada's resources as imperative to the country's long-term prosperity, and advanced neo-Marxism in the academy and in the universities. The dissertation interrogates internal debates within the New Democratic Party over how to respond to the problem of American dependency; the rise and fall of the Waffle movement; the left nationalist response to crises in Canadian-American relations during the late 1960s and early 1970s; and the establishment of the New Canadian Political Economy, left nationalism's most enduring legacy.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada",

This thesis utilizes a history of emotions framework to analyze the position of the family in this violence, particularly in how parents of children's euthanasia victims acted during the Second World War and how they portrayed their actions after the fall of the Nazi regime. Postwar testimonies demonstrate that parents did play an active part (sometimes unknowingly) in the program and its postwar legacies through their emotional navigation of consent, acceptance of institutionalization, and opposition. In all three instances, despite the differing approaches to the Nazi \"life unworthy of life\" idea, parents portrayed their emotions and actions as being influenced by what was best for their children.","subject": "European History","location": "Germany",

This focus allows the study to explore the relationship between officers' individual agency and structure in the implementation of Canadian refugee policy, and to present a hitherto under-represented part of Canada's immigration history. The research argues that the context and conditions of refugee selection can be more fully understood by explaining: the material and ideational structures within which the officers (hearers) navigated; the many types of relationships they negotiated; and the narratives they created, both about themselves and about their role in refugee selection. This work conceptualizes the officers as \"narrators\" (past and present), \"navigators\" and \"negotiators.\" The dissertation is situated within the literature on oral history, immigration to Canada, and the interdisciplinary study of the management of migration and refugee movements. It draws on substantive oral history interviews the author conducted with the three officers. In order to situate these life stories within the prevailing state structures of the time, the research draws on primary sources, including Government of Canada policy documents, the 1976 Immigration Act, Annual Reports to Parliament on Immigration Levels Plans and Ministry of Employment and Immigration Statistics. This work argues that, notwithstanding limitations on their autonomy, the degree and nature of discretion and agency that officers exercised varied depending on the local context of implementation and the particularities of the refugee applicant or situation. Together, the life stories reflect a collective narrative about the settings, conditions, constraints and interests that shaped how the officers \"heard\" refugee applicant stories while they implemented Canada's humanitarian and resettlement policy through the Africa Refugee Program, in its earliest and formative years. Collectively, the life stories put a human face on complex bureaucratic processes, and demonstrate that individual agency matters and affect; S outcomes in policy implementation. ‚Äö√Ñ√â","subject": "Canadian History; International Law and Relations;African History","location": "Canada;Africa",

Instead of being \"completely safe,\" as advertisements had promised, thalidomide caused \"deformities\" in children born to mothers who took the drug. In Canada thalidomide was licensed for prescription use on April 1, 1961 and remained on the market until the spring of 1962, despite knowledge of the possible connection between the medication and birth defects in newborns. This dissertation focuses on thalidomers' lives after the scandal. It argues that in Canada, thalidomiders' experiences in the aftermath of the tragedy demonstrate that their disabled bodies remained political and public bodies, even in the most intimate and private aspects of their lives. Drawing on disability history and medical history, this dissertation extends the approach of patient histories to include thalidomiders' social lives and disability as a lived experience. Because disability is always political, this case study of thalidomiders in Canada builds on the feminist critique of a public/private dichotomy and suggests that people living with disabilities do not simply blur but always transgress the public/private divide. Through an examination of rehabilitation, school, families, sexuality and reproduction, this dissertation demonstrates that thalidomiders' lives were political as they, both inadvertently and intentionally, confronted notions of normality and engendered the limits of socially-prescribed norms. In addition, their very existence challenged ideas of humanness and belonging, and their lives were defined by their conscious and subconscious resistance to notions of abject bodies. Canadian thalidomiders have challenged the cultural importance of physical \"normality\" in Canada through everyday performances, and counteracted deep-seated fears of difference and \"the abnormal\" through their presence in communities. This dissertation is the first study to use oral history methodology to bring the voices of Canadian thalidomiders to the attention of scholars.","subject": "Canadian History; Rehabilitation and Therapy","location": "Canada",

This study is the first full account of the Canadian government's response based on an examination of the archival records of the Departments of External Affairs, National Defence, Manpower and Immigration, and the Privy Council Office. Underlying the government's reaction were differences of opinion about Canada's approach to the Cold War, its role at the United Nations and in NATO, the utility of the Department of External Affairs, and decisions about refugees.

There are also three chapters that focus on how territorial and route surveying played a critical role for both Simcoes, serving as a scientific foundation for reframing Upper Canada as a territory and a population. It does so by offering a re-examination of both their well-known private and public correspondence written in this decade, and also some select paintings and maps through which their ideas of governance and political and cultural visions were expressed. The dissertation's reading and contextualisation of this archive is informed by Michel Foucault's lectures on governmentality, critical cartographic histories, and imperial and colonial historiographies, all of which are brought into conversation with historical studies of Upper Canada.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada;Upper Canada",

This thesis explores his rhetorical use of pathos, ethos, and logos in the Letter to show that the layers to Aelfric's seemingly bland injunctions persuaded the reader, and displayed the emotional community he envisioned for Eynsham. I also argue that while ‚àö√úlfric's audience was primarily the monks of Eynsham, the intended audience for this customary included a broader readership of reform-minded monks.

While much has been written about the economic, political, diplomatic, geopolitical, and military aspects of oil during this timeframe, there have been few investigations into the ways that cultural factors have shaped the history of oil in Britain, a gap in the literature that this study seeks to fill. Britain was one of the first industrialized nations to make the transition to oil and in the period under consideration, everyday consumption of the commodity increased dramatically, especially in the cities, where new oil technologies for heating, illumination, and transportation became commonplace conveniences. Using understudied sources such as public lectures, cartoons, advertisements, exhibitions, and architecture, the dissertation examines the discourses of transition that were created to help Britons navigate their changing energy landscapes. It maps the complexities, opportunities, and impasses that accompanied the historical rise of oil in Britain during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and argues that the system of things that brought oil from the wellhead to the consumer was predicated on a vast constellation of ideas.","subject": "Nodern History of Science; Transportation","location": "Britain",

Her biographers are discussed as representatives of each generation's feminist view of New Women.

For example, she concluded that Russia should take over Korea after the First Sino-Japanese War. Studying Bird reevaluates and historicizes the definition of New Womanhood by emphasizing how privileges of mobility and Christian missionizing were assumptions built into fin-de-siècle writing by New Women, despite how late thinkers characterized them as secular progressives, like the feminist movement.","subject": "European History; Modern; Women's Studies","location": "Britain;Asia",

The apartheid era created the conditions for poor health and provided poor healthcare for black South Africans. However, little research has been done on the history of health and healthcare provision for the South Africans who were exiled by the National Party in 1960 and more specifically on the medical sector developed by the ANC for exiles in civilian settlements and military camps based in newly independent, sympathetic nation-states in southern Africa. The exiled South Africans were affected by the legacy of colonialism, exposed to the repression of apartheid and were subject to the first efforts of the ANC's medical sector and (eventual) Health Department while they were in exile. Indeed, many health professionals who filled leadership positions in the post-apartheid Department of Health were trained in exile and had been a part of the medical sector in the liberation struggle during some portion of the thirty-year period that the ANC was in exile.

It studies how women negotiated the conditions of their service during the Second World War, resisted demobilization in 1946, and shaped the terms on which women entered the forces permanently in 1966. Drawing on official texts, unofficial histories, and personal scrapbooks, the thesis identifies the voices of women who pursued military careers and makes three arguments. First, women have actively negotiated with defence officials for a place in the armed services in war and peace. Second, servicewomen have adopted a perspective that went beyond the war in their plans for future service and their reflections on past service. Third, servicewomen crafted their legacies and pushed for recognition of female military expertise. The thesis moves beyond Ruth Roach Pierson's pioneering work on women in the Second World War to consider women's long-term identifications with the forces.","subject": "Canadian History; Military; Women's Studies","location": "Canada",

It explores the historical precedents of seasonal farm labour in Canada through the lens of the interior or the personal on the one hand, through an oral history approach, and the external or the structural on the other, in dialogue with existing scholarship and through a critical assessment of the archive. Specifically, it considers the evolution of seasonal farm work in Manitoba and British Columbia, and traces the eventual rise of an offshore labour scheme as a dominant model for agriculture at a national scale. Taking 1974 as a point of departure for the study of circular farm labour migration between Mexico and Canada, the study revisits questions surrounding Canadian views of what constitutes the ideal or injurious migrant worker, to ask critical questions about how managed farm labour migration schemes evolved in Canadian history. In addition, the dissertation explores how Mexican farm workers' migration to Canada since 1974 formed a part of a wider and extended world of Mexican migration, and seeks to record and celebrate Mexican contributions to modern Canadian agriculture in historical contexts involving diverse actors. In exploring the contexts that have driven Mexican out-migration and transnational integration, it bridges oral accounts with a broader history that sets Mexican northward migration in hemispheric context. It reads agricultural migration upon various planes, including corporeality, experience, identity, masculinity, legality, contra-modernity, and the management of mobilities.","subject": "Journalism; Cultural Anthropology; Literature - Latin American","location": "Canada;Mexico",

"title": "Kicking Through the Wall: Football, Division and Entanglement in Postwar Berlin","date": "2017","creator": "Hogg, Emmanuel","description": "Seldom is the German capital referred to as a Fusballstadt ( football-city ). When Berlin and football are mentioned together, themes of corruption, hooliganism, the Stasi, and scandal dominate. And yet, Berlin holds a rich footballing history that dates back to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and has long played an important role in the lives of Berliners as spaces for sociability. In the postwar period, two divergent competing states emerged, each with their own competing structures of football. Whereas in the Federal Republic football remained an autonomous but not apolitical space, it was explicitly politicized in East Germany. As an important form of soft power during the Cold War, the people's game reveals the extent to which the Iron Curtain was much more porous and elastic than the imagery of the Berlin Wall suggests. Rather than view football as war without the fighting , a microcosm that interprets the German and Cold War past as simplistic, reductive, and dichotomous, this dissertation analyzes the sport's inherent dynamism that presented Berliners on both sides of the Wall with unique spaces for social interaction. Although both German states tried to use the sport to assert their own interests, this dissertation argues that football simultaneously provided fans with a relatively free space authorities could not effectively control, opening the opportunity for German-German interactions. Revealing these spaces of German entanglement provides a nuanced interpretation for the ways division was experienced, constructed, and negotiated during the Cold War and after the Wende.","subject": "European History","location": "Germany;Berlin",

The efforts of Canadian anti-nuclear movements have been undervalued in histories of disarmament activism. Canadian disarmers have been dismissed as quiet in comparison to better-known movements in the United States and in Great Britain. This dissertation demonstrates that there were in fact complex and vigorous expressions of anti-nuclear sentiment in Cold War Canada. Canadian disarmers may have been few in number, and may have been conservative in their protest methods, but they were committed participants in an international struggle to protect humanity from the threat of nuclear war. There were many Canadian movements in opposition to the Bomb, both organized and disorganized, which were shaped by the diverse relationships that disarmers had to the world around them. Disarmers' endeavours were informed by engagements with feminisms, Western ideals of masculinity, parents' desires to protect their children, young people's hopes to inherit a world of peace and prosperity, longstanding ideas about social protest, concerns over domestic politics, and enthusiasm for international cooperation. Focusing on the various ways in which Canadians worked for disarmament in the early 1960s, this study demonstrates how much often divided and sometimes isolated disarmament organizations shared. This dissertation is the first extended historical analysis of anti-nuclear efforts in Canada in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is also a necessary revision of the existing historiography on disarmament activism. This dissertation brings together diverse literatures on Canada's Sixties; American, British, and Western European disarmament and peace movements; connected social movements such as the New Left, feminist movements, and environmental movements; and histories of children and childhood. The thesis offers a reassessment of these movements and their importance to an understanding of Cold War social and political dynamics.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada",

While the British government admitted its mistake in interning the refugees within months of their arrest, the Canadian government continued to keep them behind barbed wire for up to three years, reflecting its administration's anti-semitic immigration policies more broadly. Instead of using their case as a signpost in Canada's liberalizing immigration history, this dissertation situates their story in a longer narrative of class and ethnic discrimination to show the troubling foundations of modern democracy. As one tool in the nation state's normalizing project, incarceration attempted to mould the Jewish men in the state's eye. How the refugees pushed back in a joint claim of selfhood forms the material basis of this study. Through their relationship with the spaces of internment, work and leisure, sexual desire and gender performance, and by protesting governmental power, the refugees' identities evolved and coalesced, demonstrating the fluidity of modern selfhood despite the limiting power of nationhood. The internees' evolving sense of self played a large role in their experience and the development of their collective postwar narrative which trumpets their own success in Canada; while the state differentiated them from its own citizenry, the Jewish refugees pushed back in order to be seen as valuable contributors to the national body. Consequently, their collective memory of internment as a continuation of that project and, finally, as evidence of its fulfillment constitutes a critical part of internment history. By broadening the framework of Jewish internment during WWII, a pattern of differing and detaining under the mores of modern democracy emerges.","subject": "Modern","location": "Canada;Europe",

Scholars have thus far categorized this polemic as a typical and traditional guidebook designed to aid monks in the refutation of Jews using scripture, logical argumentation, and an engagement with post-biblical Jewish holy text (and in this case, the Talmud). Despite this categorization, scholars have neglected to discuss the role of emotions in categorizing Judaism. I argue that Peter uses the emotional rhetoric of disgust to alter the traditional polemical purpose ascribed to it. When Peter compares Jews to useless vomit , he suggests that a Jewish way of thinking is filthy and worthy of disgust. These acts allow Peter the ability to unify and define his own version of Christian thought, and contrast it with the framework of thinking adopted by his rival monastic group, the Cistercians.","subject": "History","location": "France;Cluny",

Approaching rural life and culture as a history of vision provides a new analytical lens for investigating the ways that rural people encountered, negotiated, and responded to the transformations being felt in both rural and urban places at the time. Informed by sensory history and visual culture studies, this unconventional perspective provides a coherent surface for cultural analysis across topics that are not traditionally discussed together, bringing to light and recuperating a variety of overlooked aspects of rural culture and knowledge. In their encounters with natural science, consumer culture, new technologies, and the Canadian state, rural Nova Scotians engaged in historically-specific practices of observation and articulated unique ideas about vision, which were frequently interlaced with ideas and anxieties about modernity. Chapters include analyses of nature-study and sensory training in rural elementary schools, practices of skilled vision at agricultural exhibitions, the professionalization of optometry in rural communities, the vision of sailors in relation to new maritime navigation infrastructure, and rural outreach from the Halifax School for the Blind. The result is a cultural history that places rural communities in Nova Scotia at the centre in of a conversation about modernity in Canada in the years bracketing the turn of the twentieth century.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada;Nova Scotia",

At the same time, the regime authorized the creation of socialist comics in order to fill the gaps these regulations left in children's entertainment. However, as socialist alternatives to the perceived trash and filth represented by western comics and American influence, these East German comics were employed as extensions of the regime's education system, delivering the state's ideology in its efforts to develop the socialist personality among youth and generate genuine enthusiasm for the construction of state-socialism. Just as these comics organized children's activities and leisure time, they were taken up and read by East German children who made their own meanings of the publications' contents. As much as these comics were meant to fulfill the state's ideological agendas and foster the spirit of socialism within these readers, the children themselves understood comics in terms of the perceived freedoms they allowed. As such, children projected their own desires, interests, and tastes upon these publications. These expectations limited the range of actions available to the regime for drawing these readers into participation with socialism and the SED-state. This dissertation approaches the subject of comics in the German Democratic Republic as constructions of state power and, in keeping with Foucault's governmentality thesis, as levers of power that allowed for the perpetuation of SED control. As children understood comics in ways different from the regime, comics are also examined in terms of J‚àö¬∫rgen Habermas' critical public sphere insofar as they provided space for child-readers to make their own sense of the SED-state and the society around them despite these constructions of power. To this end, this dissertation examines archival records of the GDR youth groups and issues of Verlag Junge Welt's comics and children's magazines. This study argues that GDR comics were constructions of the regime's power at the same time that they provided fantasies of empowerment, escapism, and constructive of the experience of childhood under socialism.","subject": "European History; Modern","location": "Germany;East Germany",

Their 'prescriptions' captivated attention in both Canada and the United States, illustrating the growing search for management and improvement that dominated discussions of aging. It is argued that while aging became the specialization of experts who studied it objectively, popular messages relayed that there was an art to growing old, its success determined by preparation, attitude, and personal will.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada;US",

"title": "Irish Catholic Voluntary Associations in the Canadian Liberal Order, 1840-1882","date": "2016","creator": "McLaughlin, Mike","description": "This study will explore the ways in which Irish Catholic voluntary associations engaged with the Canadian liberal order in the nineteenth century by focusing especially on three specific associations that were formed at particular times to confront particular social problems: temperance societies, the Catholic League, and Home Rule branches. Some of these organizations opposed liberalism and the liberal state, while others disseminated liberal values. Some, like temperance societies, did both. Informed by Ian McKay's Liberal Order Framework, I have framed the Canadian context within which Irish Catholic voluntary associations functioned as a liberalizing society with a strong attachment to Protestant British identity. In studies focusing on state formation, democracy, and liberalism, scholars such as Alan Greer and Ian Radforth, Jeffrey McNairn, and Darren Ferry have positioned mainstream voluntary associations as having had a central role in the development of liberalism and the formation of the Canadian state. This study sets out to examine the extent to which Irish Catholic voluntary associations had a similar function.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada",

Anxieties about a potential Japanese attack began to grow. British Columbia's newspapers discussed fear and anxiety through their articles, editorials and opinion pieces, bringing together the thoughts and words of Canada's military and government officials, and the writers and readers of the newspapers. The newspaper pieces dealing with the potential threat appeared most frequently surrounding major events in the Pacific, notably the attack on Pearl Harbor, the shelling of Estevan Point, and the Japanese occupation of the Aleutian Islands. Fear and threat were presented, debated, and reshaped within these newspaper communities. As the nature of the Japanese threat evolved with each major incident in the Pacific, so too did the discussions of fear.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada;British Columbia;Japan",

It explores films including High Noon, Rio Bravo, and The Searchers, as well as print advertising from Levi's and Marlboro, to juxtapose different projections of masculinity. It finds that, contrary to expectation, the cowboy was not just a singular image of stoicism and martial power, opposed to domesticity and consumerism. Instead, he was more of a language through which different values could be expressed. This creates an intriguingly contradictory image: the cowboy is domesticity and anti-domesticity, invincibility and anxiety, fashion and anti-fashion, and a relic of America's past and the herald of its future all at once. In this regard he becomes a surrogate for diverse masculinities interacting on the backdrop of the early Cold War.","subject": "United States History; American Studies; Gender Studies","location": "US",

Through commemorations, historical tableaux, exhibitions of artefacts, and the publication, Transactions, they participated in the construction of a nationalist and imperialist collective memory, celebrating connections to the British Empire, a mythologized settler past, and Ottawa's evolution from lumber town to national capital. Analysis of the origins, class and ethnicity of the Society shows that French-Canadian participation fell and membership broadened as Ottawa became a government town. The thesis describes competition from the male-dominated Bytown Pioneer Association in 1923 over the commemoration of Colonel By, and it posits that the masculinization of the historical profession led the Society to abandon written accounts in Transactions, and focus upon the collection and display of artefacts in the Bytown Museum.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada;Ottawa",

"title": "Behind Closed Doors: Domestic Violence, Citizenship and State-Making in Divided Berlin, 1969-1990","date": "2016","creator": "Freeland, Jane Elizabeth Cooper","description": "This dissertation investigates the approaches taken to address domestic violence in East and West Berlin between 1969 and 1990. Both Germanys created a language to define domestic violence, which not only reflected and reinforced their self-definition as liberal or socialist states, but did so in a way that had important consequences for women and marginalized communities. Indeed, the contested interactions between the state, activists and citizens in responding to gender violence often centred on competing ideas on the role of gender and gender equality in society. Through an analysis of official state and grassroots responses to domestic violence, this dissertation argues that in addressing these forms of violence, competing visions of citizenship were negotiated by politicians, everyday Germans and activists alike. Although official efforts often only solidified normative heteropatriarchal visions of gender relationships, activists from either side of the Berlin Wall used citizenship as a standpoint to critique the state for failing to protect women from violence. Despite different levels of support available to women living with abusive partners in East and West, women across Germany were primarily responsible for tackling domestic violence and fomenting everyday gender equality. Placing the stories of East and West together then, makes these historically constituted processes of women's marginalization visible, highlighting the similarities that existed across the Berlin Wall, despite very different political systems. This research, one of the first in depth historical examinations of domestic violence in Germany, sheds light on the role of gender in the postwar processes of state-making in East and West by examining how domestic abuse was addressed and discussed at the state level, by feminist activists and by citizens, critically looking at how this impacted women's lives and their ability to leave a violent partner. This not only provides insight into how women's voices are heard within and by the state, but it also draws our attention to the way violence works to create and reinforce gendered forms of citizenship.‚Äö√Ñ√â","subject": "European History","location": "Germany;Berlin",

Dissatisfied with traditional historical priorities Scottish historians changed the focus of their writing to reflect what was more relevant to contemporary sensibilities, giving new importance to the social aspects of daily life, the inward life of the sentiments, and the history of manners. This refocusing of historical emphasis was a response to a vibrant commercial society, to the era's social interests, to the period's predilection for delicate sensibilities and refined feelings, and to a burgeoning middle class. One of these new genres of historical writing was called conjectural history. This study discusses conjectural history, it asks a methodological question, and it looks at several different examples of the historical genres being written at this time.","subject": "European History","location": "Scotland",

It traces the wartime experience of the mariners and discusses their postwar treatment. By examining the factors that contributed to the mariners' initial exclusion as veterans, this study sheds light on the complex process whereby the state evaluates and then reassesses what is owed to those who serve. It demonstrates that concepts of veteranhood are fluid, and, that in the case of the Merchant Navy, once neglected wartime narratives can be reincorporated into the nation's military past. In the case of the Merchant Navy, renewed public engagement with Canada's social memory of its involvement in two world wars helped the merchant seamen find an audience willing to validate their claims. This study of Merchant Navy redress serves as an exploration into the nature of the state-veteran relationship.","subject": "Military","location": "Canada",

It argues that traditional performances, such as music and dance, have acquired a provenance with particular histories. This has made them both meaningful and politically contentious expressions of Irish identity. Memory tensions emerged when the performances were integrated into a new repertoire in Canada. Taylor's concept is modified and applied to embodied encounters with landscape and weather. As experiences of a new place are incorporated into a spatial repertoire, they become infused with emotional significance, and emigrants' stories about visiting Ireland, surviving Manitoban winters, or driving across flat prairie spaces, communicate feelings of displacement and belonging.

The films depict the white, working-class male as the model driver and the automobile as a bastion of safety, as well as the key to a prosperous economy. While this shift in the representation of the automobile and its driver can be attributed in part to the reported saturation of the automobile market through the latter part of the 1920s and the economic uncertainty of the 1930s, semiotic analysis of the films indicates that the change was more than an effort to attract prospective consumers. Rather, the films' idealization of the working class was tailored to present a narrative of motoring that supported automakers and industrial capitalism in a period when both were being challenged.","subject": "United States History; American Studies; Transportation","location": "US",

This dissertation allows us to probe reformist commentary from the first two thirds of the twentieth century, primarily discourse between 1920 and the mid-1950s regarding imprisonment and parole-related measures pertaining to adult men. Scholarship on nineteenth- or twentieth-century reformist penal activity, or on social reform more generally, has often identified ways in which such activity proved quite consonant with more conservative assumptions or outcomes than would sit well with present-day progressive readers. My dissertation, by contrast, numbers among the studies which associate penal reformers' outlook primarily with liberal or progressive perspectives. In this particular study, the liberal tenor of their mentality will register in our minds through an assessment of the ethical assumptions that reformers displayed, especially their assumptions concerning condemnation, exclusion, coercion, and compassion. Reformers‚speeches, publications, and so forth allow us to highlight four ‚moral sources‚ due to which they thought their penal perspective qualified as compelling: Christianity, the notion of humanness, the meritoriousness of technique, and the idea of justice. Their commentary assigned priority to technique-related rhetoric, to statements that associated penal activity, including rehabilitative tactics, with instrumentalist plans through which ‚the protection‚ with which the citizenry was enamoured would materialize. Yet even though reformers' arguments savoured primarily of instrumentalist assumptions, neither justice nor compassion was wholly neglected in their discourse. In fact, reformers hit upon a defensible affirmation of quasi-compassionate ideas thanks to instrumentalist rhetoric itself.","subject": "Canadian History; Criminology and Penology; Philosophy","location": "Canada",

To contextualize these lived experiences, this thesis also explores the development of a culture of merit, representation, and employment equity within the federal civil service in the twentieth century. Stories of work were provided within the frame of larger life stories, allowing narrators to speak to both their perceptions of the civil service as an employer and also the role and meaning of this work within their lives. As a result, this thesis argues that the complexity of individual experiences, identity formation, and memory make it difficult to generalize about the Indigenous civil servant in any meaningful way.

"title": "The Rhetoric of Dominion Income Taxation and the Modern Political Imaginary in Canada, 1910-1945","date": "2014","creator": "Tough, David G.","description": "This thesis uses Quentin Skinner's study of rhetoric to interrogate the origins of the modern political imaginary in Canada between 1910 and 1945. The Dominion taxing power was the object of a sustained rhetorical critique in the early 20th century, in which the Liberal and Conservative party identities, built around the protective tariff in the post-Confederation era, were slowly weakened and supplemented with a new representation of difference: the left-right spectrum. Beginning in 1910 with the Grain Growers' Guide, the nationalist resonances of the Dominion tariff were cast as duplicitous distractions from exploitation and fiscal inefficiency. During the First World War, this characterization of the tariff and the political differences it produced became tied to demands for ‚Äö√Ñ√≤conscription of wealth,' as the basis of a fairer and more democratic political culture. A species of what Ian McKay calls a people's enlightenment, this critique resulted in the first Dominion income tax, the Income War Tax of 1917. A Dominion income tax introduced the new possibility of transferring income that had been taxed progressively from one region to another. The catastrophic economic depression of the 1930s exposed the weakness of the tariff as a fiscal instrument; a more powerful Dominion income tax was cast as the necessary solution to the crisis, and was duly introduced in 1941 and 1942. With these changes, income taxation became a universal burden and the possible basis for large-scale Dominion social programs like the Family Allowances ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a combination that Shirley Tillotson calls the citizenship of contribution. In recognition of this new possibility, party programs for the redistribution of income were aligned on a left-right spectrum. The displacement of the old party system and the establishment of the new spectrum were both examples of what is here termed political modernism, creating a new and modern political imaginary for a democratic politics of redistribution.","subject": "Canada - History; Finance; Rhetoric","location": "Canada",

The history of faculty labour action at Carleton has been told but not that of either academic librarians or support staff so this case of unionism provides a unique opportunity to compare their experiences. Working primarily with oral histories, I argue that status was critical to mobilizing labour action at Carleton.

The discussion considers the influence of parlour spaces, gendered prescriptions, ideals of refinement, and the mediating influence of individual personality and situation. It also examines instrument purchase, music education, sheet music repertoire, and the introduction of the player piano. The final two chapters of this study address the Great War's effect on the status quo, stressing themes of continuity as well as change in musical practices. The dissertation concludes with a short summary of the post-war decline of both the Canadian piano industry and amateur music making in general.

In the second half of the twentieth century, however, as the importance of folklore in the creation of the national identity diminished in favour of modernization, the government gradually singled out the Travellers as a problematic minority that needed to be assimilated into the majority population.

Initially assembled for the 1883 International Fisheries Exhibition in London, the Fisheries Museum was a hybrid of natural history museum and industrial exhibition that modeled fish and fisheries as national possessions under progressive state administration. In 1918, after an extensive renovation, the museum was closed and the collection dispersed. The Fisheries Museum's demise raises questions about museological permanency and power, particularly the authority of natural history museums to produce what Jens Andermann calls \"hegemonic figurations\" of nature and nation. This study focused on the museum's practices of curating, collecting, cataloging, modeling, and exhibiting‚ examines how the museum navigated its material and conceptual challenges as it sought to model Canada's aquatic nature. These included the museum's spatial constraints, the authenticity of fish models, the museum's competing local and national roles, the professionalization of government science, and the gendered shift from production to consumption in fisheries administration. These challenges necessitated an ongoing project of remodeling as the Fisheries Museum sought to stabilize and maintain its authority. Remodeling also shaped the construction of curatorial authority, evidenced in the career of Andrew Halkett. Halkett, a self-trained naturalist and member of the Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club, negotiated changing ideals of masculine identity as he rose from a clerical position to become the museum's curator, engaged in Arctic expeditions and acclimatization. This dissertation resurrects a \"lost\" museum, with exhibits spanning fish culture, whale skeletons, and fish restaurants at the Canadian National Exhibition. Drawing on museum studies, environmental and fisheries history, state formation, and gender studies, it reveals the Fisheries Museum as an arena where ideas about fish, the role of state administration, and the construction of masculine authority were tested and contested.","subject": "Canadian History; Canadian Studies","location": "Canada;Canadian Fisheries Museum",

From 1925 to 1935, as a research analyst and author for the Foreign Policy Association (FPA), she gained international recognition for her scholarship on the problems and challenges confronting the Middle East and the British Mandate in Palestine, the central ground of dispute between the Arab and Jewish peoples. MacCallum joined Canada's Department of External Affairs (DEA) in 1942, not as a regional specialist, but as a wartime clerk. Where there had been previously no clear official thinking regarding the Middle East, MacCallum, using a combination of expertise and persistence, slowly gained recognition among her peers for her understanding of the region. The purpose of this thesis is to examine MacCallum's ideas about the Middle East by investigating the foundation, development, and substance of her ideas about the region. The thesis also identifies the role that she played in the Department of External Affairs and interrogates the manner in which she applied her ideas as a member of the DEA. In particular, this study assesses her part in the making of Canada's first policy towards the Middle East, which came together in 1947. In assessing MacCallum's ideas and her role as a member of the Department of External Affairs during the period 1942-1947, the thesis contends that she can best be understood as an outsider ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ a specialist in a department of generalists, a woman in a department of men, and an Arabist in a department dominated by Eurocentric and balance of power thinking. The thesis explores her efforts to put into practice her ideas as a basis for Canada's approach to the Arab-Zionist dispute. The thesis further demonstrates that MacCallum made clear the dangers that the problem of Palestine posed to international peace and security, and the likely split that it would cause among the Great Powers over the territory's fate.

Using nostalgic modernism (characterized by scholars as a deeply-rooted impulse that causes Americans to simultaneously embrace and resist change) as a framework, my research demonstrates that the wide promotion of so-called pure food in the years both before and after the passing of this legislation reflects the pervasive ambivalence to modernity emblematic of this period. This project will demonstrate how food advertising reflected wider anxieties about a nation being reshaped by urbanization, industrialization, and corporate capitalism.","subject": "United States History; American Studies;History","location": "US",

There is a specific focus on how spaces were mapped, conceptualized, and rationalized from native, to fur trade, and finally as settler space. Emphasizing the early surveying projects of the interior of Rupert's Land (1749-1805), the establishment of the Red River Settlement (1804-1820), and the 1857 British Parliamentary Inquiry of the HBC, this thesis argues that the desire to seek geographical knowledge was born from an enlightenment yearning to advance scientific understanding of geography through cartography, but was ultimately advanced by the HBC as a means to make the spaces of their imperium into ones that were secure, rational, and governable. Map-making projects both defined and ultimately ended HBC's imperium in Rupert's Land.","subject": "Canadian History","location": "Canada;Manitoba",

It posits that the magazine's food content variously constructed, defined and contested class and gender identities, and that the war years present an ideal opportunity for understanding how this process took place. Proof of this argument includes analysis of advertisements, recipes, editorial and advice columns, and government propaganda that appeared in the magazine. This weight of textual and illustrative material demonstrates that during the war years an idealized depiction of women's food roles arose that encouraged the adoption and performative reproduction of food habits most consistently defined by conspicuous production and conspicuous non-consumption. The magazine's national reach made it the ideal medium for government and corporate actors to communicate to Canadians modern ideas about food that sought to destabilize culturally and geographically distinct local foodways.","subject": "Canadian History; Gender Studies","location": "Canada",

With a focus on the capital city of Victoria and the interior Kootenay region, this thesis argues that case files, press reports, and associated political and legal texts allow scholars to gain a better understanding of Victorian ideologies, especially when contextualized within the moral and physical geographies of British Columbia. By paying greater attention to the discourses of gender and sexuality and how they intertwined with changing concepts of governance in late-Victorian British Columbian society, we can have a more in-depth understanding of the province's regional history. The conclusions of this thesis point to the need for more social histories of nineteenth-century British Columbia in order to better understand the province's (re)making as a settler society and culture.","subject": "Canadian History; Gender Studies; Law","location": "Canada;British Columbia",

Looking specifically at colonial Ghana, this study analyzes the effects of anti-slavery legislation and the presence of the Basel Mission Society on the lives of African children. It argues that as the institution of slavery went into decline in West Africa, the forced labour of children actually became more common. In its analysis of children and forced labour, this thesis will make clear that there is, in fact, a great deal of insight to be gained from including children in the narrative. In doing so, assumptions about key themes such as the racialization of labour, the gender division of labour, and the capacity of children to negotiate and shape the terms of their labour can be complicated.","subject": "African History","location": "Africa;Ghana",

By engaging with novels by William Browne Hockley, William Delafield Arnold, Meadows Taylor, James Grant, and Wilkie Collins, a wide-range of metropolitan and Anglo-Indian perspectives will provide a sense of the diverse ways that India was represented to, and understood by British audiences in the nineteenth century. Representations of tobacco and opium in these novels shifted from playing a weaker, metonymic role in the narrative to becoming heavily charged metaphors that associated these imperial commodities with “mutiny,” influencing modern British consumer culture in the last half of the nineteenth century.","subject": "United Kingdom;India","location": "India;Britain",

Proto-eugenics is the name given to the ideas of biological and racial improvement developed by leading Mexican thinkers in the late nineteenth-century, until the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Proto-eugenic thought was most concerned with eliminating immoral and degenerate traits that could be passed down from parent to child, and encouraging those with prized traits to have children. Through discussion of writings on criminality and education, this thesis argues that proto-eugenic thought had a large influence on the development of Mexican eugenics in the twentieth-century, and the importance of proto-eugenic thought on nationalism in the Porfiriato.

The memorial, called The Response to capture Canada’s answer to the call to duty in 1914, was not unveiled until May 1939. After the Second World War, the role and meaning of the monument underwent a remaking.

The Society reflected family and economic relations that underlay local social structures, allowing a few Francophones to be leaders even as Anglophones kept majority control. _ The Society represented the agricultural community as materially modem and progressive, but ignored issues of rural depopulation and marginalization and only slowly accommodated the wider needs of the town. The Board and its captive local press emphasized the masculine elements of the fair in defining rural life.

The thesis then examines the “A and B” textual versions of the play and offers an analysis of a performance of Doctor Faustus at the Globe Theatre in London in August, 2011. Through Doctor Faustus, Marlowe represents Catholicism as spiritually powerless yet politically dangerous: a theme which appears in other literature of the Elizabethan period. Analyzing the performative possibilities of the play shows that these negative representations of Catholics can be diminished or enhanced depending on dramaturgical choices. The Globe theatre’s production of Doctor Faustus reflected the religious tensions found in the text; although Doctor Faustus contains anti-Catholic language and images, this remains only one part of Marlowe’s larger representation of the religious ambiguities of the Elizabethan period.","subject": "Catholicisim; Literature","location": "Britain;London",

Specifically, I consider the positive representation of femininity, materiality, sexual desire, and sexual expression in the work of Franz Werfel, a member of the Prague Jewish literary circle. I argue that Werfel refuted popular binarisms that tended to support masculinist thinking and uneven power relations. His writing explores processes of alienation by framing inter- subjectivity in terms of sexual identity. Following a tradition established by the Jewish theologian Martin Buber, Werfel links eroticism to mystical expressions of spirituality and creativity. In order to situate Werfel’s Buberian-derived thought more closely among contemporary theories, I bring his work into conversation with several Austrian Jewish writers while tracing other ideas that contributed to his feminist literature.","subject": "Jews ;Study and teaching;History, Modern;Germanic literature","location": "Europe;Prague",

The Peace Tower flag, the Highway of Heroes and the “Support Our Troops” decals — three potent symbols which garnered considerable attention during the war — prompted widespread debates among Canadians as how to best mark and honour the sacrifices of the fallen. As the private grief of Canadians filled the public sphere, emotional impulses were notable, but they were overtaken by “instrumental” concerns of political and commercial interests.","subject": "Armed forces ;Study and teaching;Afghan War, 2001 ;Casualties ;Canada","location": "Canada;Afghanistan",

By September, six months after America entered the war, Wilson’s chief confidant called together a large body of intellectuals drawn from progressive publications and top universities across the country. The members of the secretive group that developed, known only as “the Inquiry,” understood that the new importance laid on social scientific methods across the Western world placed them in a particularly powerful place as mediators of the data that could literally objectivize social scientific knowledge into nation-states. Using the Inquiry as an anchoring event, and incorporating recent work on state-formation and governmentality, this thesis offers an historical examination of the relational development of American social sciences and liberal internationalism following the American Civil War until the Peace Talks of World War One. Its unique contribution is to view internationalism not only as a product of state formation or an expression of governmentality, but as a technology used, and assisted by social scientific knowledge, to arrive at and make sense of those very state forms. Combining literatures on the history of American state-formation, liberalism, social science and internationalism, this thesis shows how the problem of how to order the world into a recognizable international sphere created a demand for “universal” knowledge about governance, to which the social sciences were able to lay claim. Supported by a widely-held faith that America reserved an exceptional place for scientific experts and their knowledge in the management of states and society, one particular ideal type | of liberal international society became the accepted pillar of internationalism we have today. The ideal type revolved around social scientific expert mediators working outside the state but invested in upholding the specific power relations ossified therein. At the same time, as social scientific knowledge shaped internationalism, the reigning concept of internationalism, built upon key liberal principles, had a tremendous influence on the disciplinary shape, methods and concepts of American social sciences as we know them today.","subject": "International law;International relations;Sociology ;Methodology","location": "US",

Beginning in 1880, the Association sought “to unite all amateur canoeists for the purpose of pleasure, health, or exploration.” Yearly encampments, which brought together enthusiasts from Canada and the United States to sleep under canvas, race canoes, “recreate,” and socialize, were central to realizing this mission. The encampments were profoundly meaningful events for many who attended. However, the construction of meaning was contingent upon practices of hierarchy and exclusion. For example, the ACA barred full membership to women, members of the working class, and people of colour, even as it engaged the “other” as labourer at the encampments. I pay particular attention to the ways in which class, gender, and race were mobilized to shape access to and experiences of recreation, but also to the broader effects of the encampments on the lives, livelihoods, and lands of rural whites, Aboriginal people, African Americans, and French Canadians. These were constructed places and communities, and the boundary-work of inclusion and exclusion that characterized them were extensions rather than departures from how place and community were being formed elsewhere. Throughout, this dissertation argues that this seemingly egalitarian and fun-loving organization, which located itself in what its organizers perceived as benign natural landscapes, also participated in a politics of exclusion, displacement, and dispossession at the core of late nineteenth-century liberalism, capitalism, and colonialism. In making such an argument, this dissertation also raises questions about what has historically constituted a “sportscape” arguing the space of competition, at least in the case of the ACA regattas, must be studied alongside those spaces of dwelling, administration, work, and travel to which it was connected. This dissertation is informed by and in conversation with literatures from the historv of sport, women'’s and gender historvy, the history of tourism, working-class and labour history, and environmental history, and it hopes that specialists in those areas will see not only its indebtedness but also some contributions back to these fields.","subject": "Recreation","location": "Canada;Us",

Insofar as they claimed direct inspiration from God, the Huguenot prophets — many of whom were as young as 8 years old — superseded the authority of the regular clergy and threatened to break the Church's monopoly on the interpretation of divine will. This prompted a reaction from Calvinist clerics who sought to delegitimize the act of prophetism in the modern era by opposing it to the principles of rationalist thought and mechanistic philosophy.

The voyageurs from Canada were required to pilot boats through the cataracts of the Nile, so that General Garnet Wolseley's relief expedition could reach General Charles Gordon, who was besieged in Khartoum, by a self-proclaimed prophet called the Mahdi. Newspapers and documents reveal that many in Canada considered this request to be a great compliment to the country. It was the first time that Britain had requested a body of Canadians for an imperial expedition. S o m e Canadians thought the expedition would be an opportunity for Canada to play a bigger role in the empire. Others in Canada expressed ambivalence towards this particular group of m e n as their representatives on an imperial campaign. The Nile Voyageurs were civilian, mostly working class men, with a proportional over-representation of Aboriginal and francophone men. The largest group of m e n was from Ottawa, many of w h o m were shantymen w h o worked in the timber trade. This study introduces and examines a large body of letters written by the Nile Voyageurs on the expedition, as well as a range of other newspaper items and manuscript documents. The study is a labour history, a history of settler-aboriginal relations, an imperial history, a history of Canadian identities, a study of the militia, a series of regional histories and a study of politics, society and culture in the 1880s. This episode provides a glimpse of colonial Canada before the Northwest rebellion and the full implementation of the Indian act. It explores Canada's imperial identity on the eve of the Imperial Federation movement, the Congo Conference and Britain's new expanded empire. The project introduces a critical discourse method based on the theory of recognition articulated by Axel Honneth.

This thesis examines the ways in which memory was reconstructed during the twentieth anniversary and in post-Wende literature and narrated to a mass audience. While commemoration employed claims of historical truth, fictions’ use of reflective nostalgia deconstructed notions of a collective East German memory and identity, arguing for a plurality of memory in narrated reconstructions of the GDR.","subject": "Berlin Wall, Berlin, Germany, 1961-1989;History, Modern","location": "West Germany;East Germany; Germany",

While the theologies between confessions changed extensively, each drew religious inspiration and solace from reading the lives of exemplars immersed in their respective confessional discourses. While Catholicism maintained the cult and the lives of saints in devotion, Catholics toiled to make hagiography into a collection of genres fit for official veneration. Extant since the early church, hagiography was a collection of literary genres about saints, which included their lives, accounts of their relics and miracles, as well as liturgical readings about them. In the early modern era, these texts provided a representation of the impact of print on religious life. Originally, early modern compilations of saints’ lives derived from the Legenda aurea (Golden Legend) by Jacobus de Voragine, which circulated broadly since the thirteenth century. By the sixteenth-century and especially after the Protestant Reformations, readers distrusted the lives found in the Legenda aurea. The Flos sanctorum revealed the changing perceptions of sainthood and saints’ lives after the Council of Trent. Amongst Catholic hagiographers, Jesuits maintained a prominent position in this culture of reading, writing, and circulating saints’ lives. As the central figure of my thesis, Ribadeneyra operated in Madrid and compiled a collection of saints’ lives that corresponded with earlv modern Catholic discourse in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. His collection of saints’ lives, the Flos sanctorum, was exceptionally popular amongst early modermn Catholic readers. Simon Ditchfield acknowledges that hagiography contains an ignored component of the histories of early modern science, religion, and politics. The exceptions to this trend are the works on early modem hagiography by Ditchfield, Alison Knowles Frazier, and David Collins. Ribadeneyra’s Flos sanctorum scarcely appears in the historiography of early modern Catholcism or Spain. Meanwhile, the study of early modern life-writing has expanded to include fruitful discussions on the lives of Protestant reformers, present in the work of Irena Backus, James Michael Weiss, and Robert Kolb. This expansion, however, has not included the study of early modern Spanish or Catholic hagiography. Themes and approaches evident in the historiography of life-writing amongst Protestant confessions appear infrequently in discussions of early modern Catholicism or Spain. This study will examine the saints’ lives in Ribadeneyra’s Flos sanctorum, which provided narratives for early modern Catholics to assert a religious identity.","subject": "Religion ;History, Modern","location": "Spain",

A Provisional Government, composed of moderate Duma members, replaced the imperial government. Nine months later, the Bolshevik party seized power, overthrew the Provisional Government, and removed Russia from the war. This “second revolution” of 1917 has been the concern of many past and present historians while the interim period of the Provisional Government has received considerably less attention. This study deals with a critical aspect of the interim period. The Provisional Government created a peace program, which came to be based on the principles of no annexations, no indemnities, and the right to self-determination, with the hopes its partners in the war. especially the United States, would accept this program and bring an end to the war. This monograph analyzes the extent to which American and Allied decision makers constituted an obstacle to the Russian Provisional Government’s peace program.","subject": "History","location": "Russia",

It has two aims. First, this project will demonstrate that some Africans chose to negotiate, influence, and resist the terms under which they were being exhibited. They did so using a wide range of methods. Second, although negotiating their labour was an important part of their experiences, this thesis will demonstrate through the use of specific examples involving the Zulu troupe, that many African performers had a multitude of encounters, experiences, and relationships that had little to do with their performances. This thesis provides a more multifaceted, balanced, and comprehensive narrative of the African experience of performing in exhibitions than typically offered in the existing literature. By keeping the African experience at the forefront of analysis and narrative, this thesis challenges historical assumptions about African performers in exhibitions during the nineteenth century.","subject": "History;African Americans ;History","location": "South Africa; US; Britain",

Trench raiding underwent three major evolutionary phases, transitioning from small, improvised affairs, to major undertakings that mirrored set-piece battles. Within this evolutionary process, trench raids served as the laboratory where the Canadians honed their tactical doctrine and experimented with new weapon systems. Trench raiding was fundamental to the development of combined arms tactics that emerged later in the war, culminating in the Hundred Days offensives, and was a key reason the Canadians earned a reputation as elite “shock troops.”","subject": "Armed forces ;Study and teaching;Military history;World War, 1914-1918 ;Canada","location": "Europe",

In so doing, it investigates how astrology was transformed by vernacularization and the introduction of print technologies. Based on a study of thirty-five surviving examples of the genre and a microhistory of the life and times of a single prognosticator, Jean Thibault, it argues that printing opened both astrological predictions (annual almanac-prognostications) and a key resource for producing them (celestial ephemerides) to an increasingly broad audience. Astrolegy was transformed from an esoteric art practiced by university physicians for a select clientele to a popular print phenomenon that provided predictions on weather, public health, commodities, warfare, and propitious times for everything from planting crops to letting blood to the general public.","subject": "Economics ;History","location": "France",

After handily winning gold in every previous Olympics, the Canadians in 1936 experienced their first ever loss, in a match with Britain. At the time, the event was passed off as an anomaly - Britain in the 1930’s was experiencing a brief fad for New World sports, and was able to assemble a team that included many British-born but Canadian-trained players. The event has since been repressed in the Canadian popular imagination. This thesis seeks to re-examine Canada’s failure at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, arguing that the failure to win must be seen in terms of unique tensions, particularly the struggle to free hockey from the grip on nineteenth- century notions of amateurism and the uniquely Canadian insistence on linking community representation with the international sport. Using archival sources and the contemporary press, the thesis concludes that the 1936 defeat played a key role in the development of Canadian conceptions of national representation and international sport.","subject": "Canada;Canadians ;Recreation;Recreation","location": "Canada;Britain",

"title": "Violence (dis)located : on the spatial implications of violence on the western front during the First World War","date": "2010","creator": "Schultz, Christopher Kenneth","description": "The trenches of the Western Front during the First World War were a space subordinated to the immense destructive capacities of industrial weaponry. Within the trench environment, however, competing discourses arose in relation to that space: those aimed at facilitating violence, those arising from being on the receiving end of violence, and also those which appropriated trench space in an act of dislocating violence from the self. This thesis explores these three central concerns first by examining the specific forms of violence prevalent on the Western Front, and then by exploring the soldiers’ competing—and at times paradoxical—interpretations of that violence to which they were exposed. The result is the articulation of a parallax, or rather the shifting of violence in war from active subject (and thus becoming a hellish agent) to passive object (and thus rendering violence mere spectacle or ornament).","subject": "Military history;Armed forces ;Study and teaching","location": "Europe",

In the City of Toronto, between 1867 and 1910, the unruly dog came to be conceived of as dangerous, destructive and diseased, and was gradually eliminated by a series of regulations requiring the identification and control of the dog by the owner, and the incarceration and adoption or extermination of the stray. Simultaneously, Toronto businessmen began to selectively breed the improved pet — the purebred dog — which was represented by the breeders as being everything the city cur was not: clean, obedient, civilized and economically valuable. While the city cur became invisible, hidden behind the walls of the dog pound, the purebred dog became a consumer product and a spectacle, placed on display at the Toronto Dog Show, alongside other marvels of modern society.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Toronto",

Ironically, it was originally a part of a courtesy campaign designed to teach Bahamians the importance of being friendly to tourists. This thesis is the first significant study of the Fergusons, basing its insights on original episode scripts, interviews and recently discovered archival audio recordings. It situates the show within the historical and cultural context of the ongoing Bahamian tourism courtesy campaigns to better understand how it transcended the limitations of its pedagogical role into the realm of abiding popular culture. The thesis concludes that, while the Fergusons of Farm Road brought an ephemeral improvement to the quality of Bahamian tourism, the program'’s real legacy lies in its function as midwife of an intrinsic vernacular national cultural consciousness and identity.","subject": "History;African Americans ;Communication","location": "Bahamas",

In a society that had come to recognize and acknowledge the presence of the breadwinner ideal, the economic instabilities of the thirties pushed and stretched the family waged economy to the extreme. This study aims to engage with and reveal the experiences of working-class married men and their families during the 1930s, with a specific focus on masculinity. The collection of letters and testimonies illustrate the humiliation, shame, and disgrace that unemployment brought to many men and their families. It also shows to what extent all members of the family went to maintain the ideal, and the many beliefs associated with it. In doing so, it highlights why government policies based on the ideal remained popular and, maybe why, later on, the adoption and the maintenance of the welfare state remained such a contested affair. The study also demonstrates that if the depression-era was a time of hardship, challenge, and contradiction for government and society alike, the notion of the importance that the male breadwinner played within Canadian society showed a remarkable resilience.","subject": "Depressions ;1929 ; Gender mainstreaming;Canada","location": "Canada",

In particular it inquires into how choir monks dealt with the conceptual problem posed by lay brothers as monks who did not pray, and their relationship to the monks themselves. It demonstrates that the character and institutional role of the lay brother was not static, but continued to evolve over the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries within Cistercian discourse and was subject to varying interpretations according to time and place. This project considers rhetorical and legislative strategies by which lay brothers could be integrated ideologically and practically into the Cistercian hierarchy. The analysis centres around four key sources demonstrating how lay brothers were represented in a number of literary genres over time, including customaries, statutes, sermons, and miracle stories. The variation in the representation of lay brothers in these documents indicates not only that the status of lay brothers was subject to debate, but also that the creation of their role was an active process. ‘","subject": "Medieval ages;Church History;Cistercians;Cistercians;Spiritual life","location": "Europe",

In eventual funding applications to the Canadian International Development Agency and the Canadian Hunger Foundation, Ford conceived of her small project growing into a multiple service center, facilitating women’s access to basic education, a medical clinic, and other welfare services, to be sustained in the long-run by community self-help. Skillfully, she applied the principles of the Women in Development model to her project, demonstrating a keen awareness of important development discourse changes to affect women throughout the 1970s. Ultimately however, Ford’s project failed to reach its self- sustainability goals. This study considers the dominant paradigm shift in development discourse during the 1970s that recognized women as strong potential agents of their own development and how this was misappropriated in Gatina as a result of important implications in colonial and development rhetoric. It also makes a case for the utility of history in development studies as it considers the contemporary incarnation of Ford’s project in The Gatina Primary School, a project currently supported by the Amsha Africa organization.","subject": "Social structure ;Community development;Human Growth","location": "Africa;Kenya;Nairobi",

"title": "Music and power : a conservative musical soundscape in Britain, 1830-1850","date": "2010","creator": "Guiguet, Kristina Marie","description": "Music was pervasive in nineteenth-century life, but has seldom been considered as an integral form of political and social discourse. A core problem for cultural history is a reliable methodology for asking period audiences what music meant to their daily lives and formal politics. Building out from the private concert programmes and diary of the wealthy gentry woman, Lady Hunter, a whole landscape or “soundscape” of related sites of musical activity is found to have been a coherent, conservative community. Whether in drawing-room concerts, the private Noblemen and Gentlemen’s Catch Club of London, public, professional performances of opera and chamber music, or the short-lived Conservative Festivals (a form of convivial, political dinners), musical life was a form of cultural and political opposition to 1830s Reform. A wide range of documentation associated with private concert programmes, including private papers, newspaper reports, sheet music, and architectural drawings, is informed by extensive secondary scholarship in cultural, social, gender and political history, and musicology. Records of musical life, like programmes, reveal audience musical preferences but rarely describe musical choices in terms of political values, ideas, or beliefs. A new lexicon for such intentions in musical life is developed through close analysis of the music and song lyrics chosen for the Conservative Festivals. Held between 1835 and 1841 to restore the political Party’s Parliamentary fortunes in the wake of Reform, the Festivals used a diverse range of music that was tightly consistent with Conservative arguments in favour of the heritable, hierarchical class system. The lexicon is applied across the many kinds of musical performance of Lady Hunter’s musical world. The use of music in conservative politics and leisure between 1830 and 1848 was unified by the concept of a conservative musical soundscape, a virtual community supporting the idea that hierarchies of intrinsically different kinds of human beings marked by class and gender were natural, historic, and good. The silken drawing room concerts of the astoundingly wealthy Lady Hunter were at the heart of a class-crossing soundscape of conservative values, demonstrating that musical life of the time was a discourse of personal and civic power.","subject": "Soundscapes (Music) ;Great Britain ;19th century;Music ;Great Britain ;19th century;History And Criticism;Music and historty ;Great Britain ;19th century;Music ;Social Aspects;Great Britain ;19th century;Music, Influence of ;Great Britain ;19th century;Musical analysis; Gender mainstreaming","location": "Britain",

It brings new insights into the development of this movement, especially concerning its interactions with government agencies and police, its methods, its internal tensions and debates, and its relations with the wider Canadian political culture. More precisely, it shows how the movement had an impact on government policy through various tactics. Government actions, such as police surveillance and policy shifts, affected the movement’s priorities. In turn, the war resisters and their supporters contributed to debates about nationalism and Canada’s relationship to the United States. ‘This thesis explores specific relationships — between Canadians and Americans, activists and the public, as well as support groups and government agencies, including police. The actions of anti-draft groups in promoting the government’s programs while still pressing for positive change were a characteristic case of interpenetration between the “state” and “society,” and their mutual reinforcement. All this occurred at a moment when the idea of Canada as a “refuge from militarism” was entering the vernacular as one of the key myths about the nation. The myth, which this thesis questions, has become that Canada, a more peaceful country than the United States, allowed the draft dodgers and deserters from south of the border to find refuge from militarism.","subject": "Vietnam War, 1961-1975 ;Draft resisters;Political culture ;Canada","location": "Canada;US",

This period represents the nadir and the conditions for the apogee of postwar air force fortunes, in terms of organizational size and capabilities. There were a range of influences on the postwar growth of the RCAF. The Soviet Union posed a threat to North American and European security and the air force was best situated to respond to it. Defence collaboration with the United States fostered development of a vast air defence system. The creation of a NATO Integrated Force led t0 a large fighter-interceptor contribution from Canada. RCAF leadership was effective in presenting plans to the government and in managing air force interests. Political leaders within Canada in the late 1940s embraced opportunities to engage with the international community and take part in multilateral defence initiatives. Theories of civil-military relations inform assessments of the interaction between the government and the RCAF. The dissertation concludes that all of these influenced, in varying degrees, the nature and degree of success of RCAF, but focuses on the crucial role of planning and professionalism. Improvements to planning processes, procedures and capabilities allowed an increasingly professional RCAF to take advantage of these opportunities, resulting in the creation of a Cold War air force.","subject": "Cold War;World politics ;1945-1989","location": "Canada",

"title": "If we are attacked, let us be prepared : Canada and the failure of civil defence, 1945-1963","date": "2009","creator": "Burtch, Andrew Paul","description": "During the early years of the Cold War, Canada created a civil defence organization to prepare Canadians for a possible nuclear attack. This enormous task required the cooperation of the federal, provincial, and municipal governments. A key element to its success was persuading the public to incorporate the principles of preparation into everyday life. Through exhibits, exercises, and public appeals, Canada’s civil defence agencies exhorted citizens to volunteer as air raid wardens, to stockpile essential supplies, and to build fallout shelters underground where they could wait out the nuclear storm. Drawing from the extensive records of the Department of National Defence, the Department of National Health and Welfare, the Emergency Measures Organization, along with other government and manuscript documents and media sources, this dissertation explains the evolution of Canada’s CD policies and addresses the question of why governments, institutions, and the public consistently refused to make the preparations expected of them in the face of nuclear extinction. Civil Defence proved to be a controversial and ultimately unsuccessful program. Its failure hinged on the nature of the CD relationship between the state and its citizenry, the inadequacies of government planning, and the balance of civil-military relations in Canada in the Cold War. In CD publicity, officials informed Canadians that their participation was a civic duty in the nuclear age, and equated community defence with guarding the values and freedoms associated with citizenship. Canadians rejected their prescribed obligation to support CD, some believing that an atomic defence was impossible, others arguing that the federal government or the armed forces should provide protection to civilians. The federal, provincial, and municipal governments could never agreed on the proper division of financial and political responsibility, which led to bitter debates that undermined the credibility of CD programs and confused the public. The Canadian military proved uninterested in assisting with CD, and, once enlisted by the federal government to lead national survival efforts, Canada’s soldiers proved incapable of providing any meaningful support to the civilian population. As a result of all of these factors, Canadians were unconvinced of the efficacy of strategies proposed by governments for their protection, and Canada was completely unprepared to survive a nuclear war.","subject": "Civil defense readiness ;Cold War;Atomic bomb ;Safety measures;Nuclear warfare and history ;Canada","location": "Canada",

Although the manners in which monastic authors regulate this contact remained diverse, many underscored desire to both invite guests within monastic walls or else to travel within the surrounding community to assist, teach, or establish new monasteries. Instead of threatening monastic claustration, authors often framed interaction as a means to further monks’ spiritual development. I approach early ninth-century monastic writing on interaction by genre, considering capitulary texts, a commentary on the Benedictine Rule by Smaragdus of Saint Mihiel, and hagiographic narratives. Within each of these genres, monastic authors constructed different forms of physical and mental boundaries between the monastery and the outside world. These boundaries did not serve to prevent anyone from entering or exiting the monastery, but rather heightened the power of a sacred space by drawing attention to the transition.","subject": "Carolingians ;Church History;Middle Ages, 600-1500;Monasteries ;Middle Ages, 600-1500","location": "Europe",

Between Confederation in 1867 and the end of the nineteenth century, Canada’s federal franchise law — the law that determines who may vote in Dominion elections — underwent a series of seemingly antithetical alterations. Thus far, historians and political scientists have written very little on this development of the nineteenth-century Dominion franchise. Amongst those who have, the idea that franchise reform took place during this period because of partisan expediency has tended to hold sway historiographically. Taking other factors into account — from political altruism to popular pressure — this thesis questions that historiographical trend. Certainly, partisanship still played a part in these legislative alterations. Through an application of state formation theory, this thesis argues that nineteenth-century Canadian statesmen, by means of new franchise law, in large part attempted to graft their own ideological visions of Canada onto the burgeoning nation.","subject": "Canada;History","location": "Canada",

Central to understanding Spanish Dominican societal dynamics is the underlying colonial relationship between the territory of Santo Domingo and the Spanish metropole, as well as the intra and cross-class interactions. The politics of empire provide the context for colonial dynamics; the metropole’s racialized ideal of the social hierarchy played a significant role in the creation of elite identity. The ruling group recognized the importance of representing themselves to the Spanish Crown in terms it understood. They adopted the characteristic traits the Spanish Crown associated with a ruling group: whiteness, legitimacy and purity of blood. Despite obvious practical discrepancies between the ideal and accepted practices in this colonial society, the elite sought to reflect the metropole’s idealized image through a widespread manipulation of the official record. The shared socio-cultural language formed the basis for opening and maintaining a dialogue between Spanish Dominicans and the Crown. Intra and cross-class relations shaped the formation of family networks through marriage and fictive kinship. The elite, lower class, and slaves were active participants in creating their own society. Horizontal ties created class solidarity, not just for the elite but for the subordinate groups as well, while vertical ones forged cross-class alliances. The two types of ties acted as natural checks and balances, which determined the limits of racial domination. My dissertation also employs gender analysis to determine the different meanings and values of men and women’s roles in the formation of family networks within each socio- economic group. The higher male than female immigration advantaged women on the marital market because they had access to greater spousal selection, which also translated into more opportunities for social mobility. Women, therefore, became instrumental players in family ‘marital strategies. Santo Domingo’s reputation as a peripheral colony within the Spanish empire led historians to overlook its development. However, the experience of Spanish Dominicans provides a valuable counterpoint to the more densely populated and resource rich Spanish American colonies.","subject": "Spaniards ;Dominican Republic ;Marriage ;Social Aspects;Dominican Republic ;Santo Domingo ;Kinship ;Dominican Republic ;Santo Domingo ;Social structure ;Dominican Republic ;18th century; Women ;Dominican Republic ;Santo Domingo ;Social Conditions;Social classes ;Dominican Republic ;Ellite (Social sciences) ;Dominican Republic ;History","location": "Santo Domingo;Spain;Dominican Republic",

Historians of Atlantic Canada have used the idea of deviance as an acceptable approach to the poor and homeless of the past and tacitly encourage us to see the contemporary homeless as deviants. Victorian theorists such as Malthus and Mayhew pejoratively characterized the poor as an underclass. Contemporary writers have provided evidence that challenges the use of the concept in Canada. But it remains a powerful force within American sociology, which is able to cast its influence over Canadian historical writing. It is the contention of this research that it is possible to be true to the past, to reflect the warts and downfalls of the extremely poor and homeless who lived there, but at the same time recognize their efforts to follow prevailing norms and to empathize with their plight and in doing so generate at least the possibility of recognition and empathy in the present. Such recognition and empathy may be the keys to creating and maintaining humane solutions to poverty and homelessness. The examinations conducted by this research address an area of our past that has been largely overlooked. This research supplements broad historical surveys of social welfare legislation by examining social welfare policy in action at the local level. By positioning itself at the convergence of labour history and studies of poverty, and by demonstrating that the populations examined by these discrete areas of research are more alike than different, this research shows that labour history can be extended to include many of those who lived “rough” in the past. Through its approach this ii e A e research hopes to encourage a view that can help to integrate the study of extreme poverty and homelessness into the mainstream of Canadian historiography.","subject": "Poor ;Nova Scotia ;Halifax ;Homeless persons ;Nova Scotia ;Halifax ;Public welfare ;Nova Scotia ;Social problems ;Nova Scotia ;Halifax ;History","location": "Canada;Nova Scotia;Halifax",

Although scholarship on Cold War Canada and the Communist Party of Canada (CPC) has grown, the CSFS led by Dyson Carter from 1949-1960, has received relatively little attention from historians. Moreover, few historians have noted the important role played by the Soviet All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (VOKS) in encouraging and supporting the Canadian left. This project looks at the CSFS as a blend of social and political activism, where gender, class, cthnicity, linked communities and ideology had significance. It deals with an example of foreign influence in Canada, as the elaborate pro-Soviet performances staged by the CSFS were part of a larger perception management campaign orchestrated from Moscow. This dissertation is based on archival sources previously unavailable to researchers. In addition, oral history interviews with key players have been used to reveal personal narratives and interpretations of the early Cold War. This combination allows historians an unprecedented view of how some Canadians saw their world, and how they, in turn, were seen by other Canadians and the Soviet authorities. Between 1949 and 1960, the Canadian Soviet Friendship Society aimed its message at an audience of “progressive” leftists in North America, hoping to convince others that the USSR was indeed the epitome of an egalitarian and enlightened State. Attempting to soften, define and redirect the antagonistic narratives of the day, the CSFS story is one of propaganda and persuasion in Cold War Canada.","subject": "Cold War;World politics ;1945-1989","location": "Canada;USSR",

This thesis demonstrates that Templeton’s life can also be used to investigate the ways in which he publically presented “unbelief” according to the assumptions and expectations of the culture in which he operated. Through his work in four different media — religious literature, television, novels and autobiography — Templeton’s various expressions of unbelief demonstrated an ongoing transition away from Christianity and towards an alternate interpretive framework. Moreover, his consistent framing of these expressions within the cultural context of each medium reflected four distinct “performances”: inadvertent “echoes” of unbelief in his religious literature, an “investigative” unbelief in his television interviews, a “dramatic” unbelief in his novels, and a “noble” unbelief in his autobiography.","subject": "Religion and culture;Christianity and culture","location": "Canada;Toronto",

In doing so, the evolution of both the formal and informal curriculum at two prominent black higher education institutions—Fisk University and Spelman College— will be explored to highlight ways in which the cultural, social, and economic factors effected change at these institutions. Further, this study looks at the various roles students played in shaping and re-shaping their scholastic environment. Primary sources such as course catalogs, student newspapers, administrator correspondences, and alumni files, are used to gain a fuller understanding of the context and content of these academic environments. This work also engages with a body of literature that seeks to understand how race ideology was formed and taught amongst the black middle class. Ultimately, this thesis will underscore the significance of the dynamic nature of race ideologies in black higher education.","subject": "African Americans ;Education (Higher) ;Southern states ;Socialization;Race awareness;African American college students ;Georgia ;Atlanta;African American college students ;Tennessee ;Nashville","location": "US",

By situating the movement in the broader developments of Canadian state formation, chiefly the National Policy, as well as the continental aspects of daily life in Ontario, the thesis attempts to amplify the scholarship of the continentalist movement by providing an explanation of the geneaology of the movement and its subsequent formalization as a counter-conduct aimed at reorganizing governance in the Canadian state along civic republican lines. Similarly, the thesis traces the popular manifestations of continentalism, particularly among agrarian classes, and the various reactions to these popular manifestations by the Liberal and Conservative parties between 1887-1896, leading to the eventual marginalization of the movement and the emergence by 1896 of a short-lived orthodoxy of protectionism.","subject": "Social structure ;Ontario ;19th century;Political culture ;Ontario ;19th century;Protectionism ;19th century","location": "Canada;Ontario",

"title": "Memory, identity, and the challenge of community among Ukrainians in the Sudbury region, 1901-1939","date": "2007","creator": "Zembrzycki, Stacey Raeanna","description": "This dissertation examines the ways in which Catholic, Orthodox, nationalist, and progressive Ukrainian men, women, and children, both immigrants and those of Ukrainian descent, formed a distinct ethnic community in the Sudbury region between 1901 and 1939. Specifically, it demonstrates how the community developed, paying particular attention to the ways that individual and group identities, social networks, and power relations impacted its evolution over time. Moreover, this dissertation depicts the ways in which the host society, on a local, regional, and national level, perceived and treated Sudbury’s Ukrainians. Set in a period of change for this ethnic community, the region, and the country more broadly, this dissertation offers new narratives about World War I, the so-called “Roaring Twenties,” and the Depression. In addition to viewing gender, ethnicity, class, region, and age as important categories of analysis, it regards community as a problem which ought to be studied. Community, in this instance, is not a simple and static entity, but rather an imagined reality, a social interaction, and a process. The adoption of a fluid model thereby enables an examination of the varying ways in which individuals, Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians, attached different meanings to community. These meanings, as this dissertation argues, were dependent upon the geographic spaces that these individuals occupied, the social networks to which they belonged, and the real and imagined identities and experiences that they had both within and on the margins of their communities. This dissertation not only reconstructs the contours of this ethnic community and the ways in which its members negotiated their places within and outside of it, but also includes a discussion of the author’s archive stories. Sensitive to what constitutes as an archive, it is a highly personal journey into the author’s imagined Ukrainian community, her Baba’s (grandmother) Ukrainian community, and the communities which other Ukrainians in the Sudbury region have experienced. The archive stories which wind through the narrative of this dissertation detail the challenges of working with both written and memory sources and at the same time, offer new interpretative frameworks for understanding the histories of immigrant communities.","subject": "Ukrainian Canadians ;Ontario ;Sudbury Region ;Social Conditions;Ukrinians ;Ukrainian Canadians ;Ethnic identity;World War, 1914-1918 ;Ukrainian Canadians","location": "Canada;Ontario;Sudbury",

Some of the best existing scholarship reveals that the instrumentally and procedurally focused aspects of many Canadians’ thinking in the third quarter of the century helped significantly to facilitate the eventual abolition of capital punishment. This study, however, highlights the wide range of ways in which debaters’ discourse, including discourse with an instrumentalist flavour, resulted from or conveyed their moral perspectives. Both the nature of debaters’ moral assumptions and the manner in which they were communicated suggest that moral ideas to which some Canadians sought to assign transcendent status possessed a weakened cultural credibility during this period, while moral perspectives animated by perceptions or expectations of progress exercised important cultural influence.","subject": "Capital punishment ;Capital punishment ;Moral and ethical aspects ;Capital punishment ;Public opinion;Public opinion;Canada","location": "Canada",

This thesis suggests that these two views can be reconciled through a study of liberalism—a philosophy that elevates the role of the individual. Throughout his career Cartier stressed the importance of each citizen’s right and responsibility to follow their self-interest and acquire property. Individual success and wealth would contribute to stronger and more prosperous communities, which in turn, would create a strong nation. When situated within the political culture of 1860s Quebec, Cartier’s reliance on liberal language and logic highlights a previously unexplored similarity between his party, the Bleus, and his chief critics and opponents, the Rouges. Despite opposing each other on matters of policy, this thesis will suggest that the two parties shared a liberal logic with matters of property, progress, cultural protection, and cultural cooperation.","subject": "Political culture ;Quebec (Province) ;Political participation ;Quebec (Province)Liberalism ; Nationalism ;Canada","location": "Canada;Quebec",

Its involvement in the contentious free trade debates of the mid-1980s effectively demonstrates the blue ribbon organization’s uncanny ability to broker an internal consensus within Canadian “big business” and to diplomatically advance its policy positions with the federal government and in the public forum. This thesis applies a case study approach to the Council in order to cast light on its innovative style of consensus building and thereby to further our understanding of the complex relationship between business and government in Canada. The thesis, drawing on archival materials and interviews, argues that the BCNI has fundamentally altered the nature of business-government relations in Canada, replacing the omnibus lobbying style of umbrella organizations like the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association with a more focused and proactive approach to business-government relations.","subject": "Business enterprises ;Industrial policy ;International business enterprises ;Political aspects ;Canada","location": "Canada",

Experts, influenced by the child-centric nature of postwar society, now urged parents to be responsive to the needs of the child. In addition, the counter-culture of the 1960s and the growth of psychology eroded medical authority.

These debates mainly took place among burcaucrats at the Dependents’ Allowance Board and the Indian Affairs Branch, representatives from non-government organizations, social workers, soldiers and their families. The central tensions in each of the policy debates revolved between the recognition of soldiers’ universal rights and the belief that Aboriginal people had certain “innate” racial characteristics that made them unable to receive economic benefits under the same terms as non-Aboriginal recipients. Within these debates assumptions about “race” and “gender” intertwined in complex ways around issues of morality. sexuality, “class,” and cultural beliefs. Bureaucrats™ positions were affected by such variables as their attitudes towards soldiers, their position in the bureaucratic hierarchy, their cultural beliefs, whether or not they perceived the policy as a threat to their authority and the pressures they faced from other stakeholders.

Norman Angell has traditionally been depicted as a political failure. Recent work by Hugh Peter Gaitskell McNeal has shown that this is largely because historians have a retrospective bias and have not been able to see Angell as his contemporaries would have done. Even McNeal, however, fails to appreciate fully the political significance of Angell’s work. William Scheuerman’s new book Liberal Democracy and. the Social Acceleration of Time provides a theoretical framework through which Norman Angell’s work can be more justly assessed. The present thesis represents an extension and testing of Scheuerman'’s logic and centers on the idea that the patterns of public speech which define any society’s public sphere greatly affect that society’s experience of time and by extension its politics. By altering speech patterns in the public sphere Norman Angell had a significant political impact. In a period of acceleration, when the Edwardian public sphere was becoming increasingly confrontational and anti-liberal, Norman Angell fostered a discursive space, Norman Angellism, which was characterized by the open- ended give and take of meaningful debate. In so doing Norman Angell affected his contemporaries’ experience of time, slowing things down and creating an environment more conducive to liberal practice. Contrary to George Dangerfield’s claim that England’s liberal state was on the verge of collapse in 1914, the story of Norman Angell shows that there were respected agents of liberal revival at work.","subject": "Economic history;Liberalism;World politics","location": "Britain",

Fourteen months previously, they had fled their home in East Germany due to increasing political pressure, and crossed the border into West Germany where they stayed in refugee camps until they had secured immigration visas. This thesis examines how the migration process impacted this family. Gender, family, and material culture are central themes running throughout this work, as the experiences of the members of this family are considered from the immediate postwar period to their acculturation in Canada in the late 1950s. Paramount to this study is a collection of letters which Helma and Reinhard wrote to their respective families throughout the migration process. This correspondence provides a contemporary account of how migration was cxperienced, as it was portrayed to loved ones. Furthermore, this study also relies upon the oral testimony of Helma and her daughter Beata. Helma’s oral narrative gives this thesis a particularly gendered perspective; moreover, it brings issues of memory and self-identity into discussion. Consistently, the sources emphasize the importance that family played in their lives, as they left their home for a new land, and began again in Canada. This thesis provides an account of postwar East German refugee immigration and it offers insight into the values, anxieties and joys of the postwar immigrant family as they experienced migration first-hand.","subject": "Refugees ;Refugees ;Germany (East)Immigrants ;Case Studies;Immigrants ;Social Conditions","location": "East Germany;West Germany;Canada",

As photography’s unchallenged ability to convey reality altered visual culture and modernized ‘ways of secing,” developments in Canada revolved around this new and unfolding power of representation. Representation holds that the objective truth of an image will always be hidden behind what the photographer intended and also includes the theoretical framework within which an image may be read or ‘decoded’ by a viewer. In examining the cultural and historical currency possessed by visual reproductions, this study will show how cultural meaning is derived, negotiated and reciprocated through the outcomes and uses of photographic production and reproduction. The purpose of this thesis is to identify, question and analyze photographic practice and representation in the river system comprising the ‘Far North’ part of the North-West Territories. I examine the period from 1882 to 1914. These dates respectively mark the points when the first mechanically reproduced images were created of the Athabasca-Mackenzie drainage basin, and when the commercial photographs made of that river system by C.W. Mathers reached their recirculatory zenith. C.W. Mathers created a set of commercial photographs of the Far North in 1901, and the series is placed at the centre of this study. In suggesting his images were ‘recirculating,’ I not only mean that more of Mathers’ photographs were in material circulation than at any other time, but that the power-knowledge complexes coupled with his images reached a zenith as well. I ask how Mathers’ images can explain the confluence of colonialism, modernity and photography in the North, employing an analysis of geographical imaginations of time and space scholars have conceptualized as a metropolitan(city)-frontier(hinterland) relationship.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;North West Territories",

Long considered to be a “free trade” election in the tradition of 1891 and 1911, the 1988 election is analyzed in this thesis with an eye for a more subtle political dynamic. Using theories and concepts borrowed from the field of mass communications — namely: agenda-setting, framing and priming - this study examines the manner in which political strategists and the news media created and/or facilitated their own preferred campaign narratives. In this way, these elites strove to suggest an agenda by which the electorate would be conditioned to frame its decision when casting a ballot, thereby powerfully influencing the nature and direction of the democratic dialogue. This goal was accomplished chiefly by utilizing the television medium and this thesis argues this campaign could be considered, to quote political scientist John Meisel, the first “boob-tube” election in Canada. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of archived television footage broadcast at the time, including newscasts, political party advertising and the leaders’ debate, was reinforced by oral interviews with people involved in setting the 1988 agenda. This thesis then applied mass communication concepts to a historical narrative in hopes of creating a hybrid political history, one that combines the historian’s perspective and the journalist’s and political scientist’s intensive presentism.","subject": "Television in politics ;Television broadcasting of news ;Mass media ;Political aspects ;Canada","location": "Canada",

Macdonald and the Second National Policy of William Lyon Mackenzie King. Over the course of just one generation during the early to mid-twentieth century, the federal government moved from a fairly narrow pursuit of economic development throughtariff protection, transportation subsidies, and immigration promotion to a much more expansive quest for economic and social stability through a host of new policy nitiatives such as old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, and family allowances. Thus far, this transition has been variously described as a revolution in economic thought emanating from the mind of British economist John Maynard Keynes, a dramatic re- engineering of the state by civil service mandarins who had been influenced by Keynesian ideas, a liberal-democratic response to socialism, or a natural outcome of industrialization, urbanization, the Great Depression, and other historical events. This study suggests that we can advance our understanding of this process even further by reevaluating our assumptions about the seemingly autonomous influence of individuals, ideas, and events. To do so, it seeks to dig down below the immediate causes to the longer-term transformations that propelled the transition from one policy paradigm to another. This “archaeological® approach thus directs our attention towards long-rumn developments such as the expansion of the university system, the growth of large-scale business firms, the rise of organized labour, and the centralization of the provision of social welfare into large public and private bureaucracies. Moreover, at even deeper levels, it brings us to an examination of the rise of new scientific disciplines in areas such as business, economics, and psychology, as well as the reshaping of concepts such as the individual worker, the unemployed worker, and the national income. Collectively, over the course of the late nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries, these complex and disparate transformations laid the intellectual and political groundwork for a new consensus on socio- economic policy among key interest groups in the state, academic, business, and labour communities in Canada. In short, these transformations formed the macro-political foundations of Canada’s postwar, “Keynesian” welfare state.","subject": "Welfare state ;Keynesian economics;Capitalism ;Canada","location": "Canada",

The Danes were highly sought after by Canadian governments as they were seen as agricultural, easily assimilated, and of northern stock. Danes spread themselves thinly across Canada, eroding a strong sense of identity and resulting in a historiography whose evolution, compared with that of other European ethnic groups, has been slower to accept new approaches and perspectives. This study will focus upon the 1872 to 1901 period of Danish migration and settlement in New Denmark, New Brunswick. Its first purpose is to explore political and policy aspects of New Denmark’s settlement history that had previously been neglected. Secondly, it will apply more modermn techniques of analysis, such as the use of quantitative methods, to help bring the historiography of New Denmark and Danish migration more into line with work on other European nﬁgranf groups. Four main points will be argued: firstly that only with the help of 2 Dominion subsidy was New Brunswick willing to mount a serious recruitment, immigration, and settlement scheme, secondly that there exists no hard evidence proving New Denmark’s location was chosen as a buffer against Francophone encroachment, thirdly that New Denmark represents a distinct subset of Danish emigration, and finally that in part due to poor economic conditions, immigration to New Denmark was counterbalanced by an outflow of population of similar magnitude.","subject": "Danes ;New Brunswick;Immigrants ;New Brunswick;History","location": "Canada;New Brunswick",

This study examines Stead's editorial theory, based on his self-reflective writings on journalism, and how that theory was put into practice in two particular episodes of his career at the Pall Mall Gazette, the London newspaper that he edited from 1883 to 1889. The episodes examined are Stead's involvement in General Charles Gordon's 1884 expedition to Khartoum and the famous \"Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\" exposé of child prostitution in London.","subject": "English newspapers ;19th century;Press ;Great Britain ;19th century;Mass media and history","location": "Britain;London",

As better data became available, statistical studies appeared. The texts rarely included a historical understanding of the people they studied. In the period, 1800 to 1972, at least three urban Indian communities associated themselves with Ottawa and Gatineau. The communities overlapped, but each had a separate history. They originated for different reasons; organized themselves to suit specific interests; and each had a distinct reason to associate with the cities. Ottawa’s status as capital city often played an important role. The communities are complex, because Indians are a multi-national group, and the communities had an itinerant quality, meaning their community history unfolded both inside and outside city borders.","subject": "First Nations;Urban residence ;Ontario ;Ottawa;First Nations;Urban residence ;Quebec (Province) ;Gatineau;First Nations;Ontario ;Ethnic identity;First Nations;Quebec (Province) ;Ethnic identity;First Nations;History","location": "Canada;Ottawa;Gatineau",

"title": "Under the radar: Defence Construction (1951) Limited and military infrastructure in Canada, 1950-1965","date": "2005","creator": "Noakes, Jeffrey David","description": "Established in 1950 as an element of Canada’s Cold War rearmament, Defence Construction (1951) Limited, or DCL, was Md as an agency to tender and supervise construction contracts for the Department of National Defence, a function it fulfills to this day. Such use of a Crown corporation was characteristic of Minister of Defence Production C.D. Howe and his often expedient and pragmatic approach to meeting policy objectives. In its first fifteen years, DCL helped make possible the construction of $1.5 billion in defence infrastructure, including three major radar lines, two in northern Canada. The corporation also played a role in helping the Canadian government implement civilian projects at home and abroad. Using an extensive collection of : corporate and related government records at the agency itself, at Library and Archives Canada, and at the Department of National Defence’s Directorate of History and Heritage, this dissertation examines the corporation’s history as an effective and flexible instrument of government policy. Adjunct to this function, ﬁCL helped represent the interests of the Canadian construction industry in the provision of Cold War infrastructure. By the end of the 1950s, the corporation, working in conjunction with other government agencies, had managed to ensure that American and joint Canadian- American defence projects built in Canada would use Canadian construction firms drawing on Canadian suppliers. This dissertation also encompasses and examines themes related to Canada’s northern Cold War from 1950-65. National defence, sovereignty, economic development, the expansion of Ottawa’s influence and control over northern Canada, and relations with the United States all played a role in shaping the environment in which DCL operated, and were in turn influenced by events and projects that DCL had a role in shaping. An examination of the history of DCL between 1950 and 1965, therefore, also provides a useful prism for examining these issues. Aside from these issues, the corporation’s history is also an revealing case study of a Crown corporation and its utility as an instrument of government policy; in many respects DCL served as Ottawa’s “Cold War handyman.”","subject": "Defense contracts ;Public contracts ;Cold War","location": "Canada",

"title": "The homespun economy: persistence of handweaving in New Brunswick in the nineteenth century","date": "2004","creator": "Rygiel, Judith Anne","description": "Hand made textiles played an important role in both the rural economy of colonial British North America and in the family. Offering more than a means to earn supplemental income, these textiles were often crucial to survival, especially in localities where harsh winter conditions were the norm and supplies uncertain. Handweaving was not, however, ubiquitous in colonial North American households. Weaver's account books, general store ledgers, and memoirs all show that most households often purchased textiles from other sources. This thesis explores some of the complex and multi-linked reasons for handweaving’s popularity and persistence in New Brunswick into the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Tradition was one common factor among French-speaking Acadian households, while other weavers responded to family economics, or market conditions. A case study of weavers and their neighbours in Northumberland County dispels the myth that poverty was the prime reason for persistence in this county. Instead, a niche market of outdoor workers and a cold climate fuelled the “homespun economy”. Both tradition and markets were conditioned by two other rarely studied influences. Some residents thought industrialization would soon relieve women from the drudgery of cloth making and allow them more leisure time to “cultivate their minds” and look after their families. For this to happen, politicians, entrepreneurs and lobbyists had to promote industrialized textile manufacturing. Neither government nor entrepreneurs were much interested in doing this since imported textiles generated important revenues in both imposts and commissions. Handweavers were thus able to continue supplying their niche market since there was little local competition. New ideas about women'’s work could also influence textile production. “Cultivating their minds” led women to spend more time embroidering cushions, doing fancy knitting, and decorating their homes. Tracking these trends through agricultural society reports, provincial exhibitions, poems and articles in the press gives valuable insights into this little explored aspect of home textiles. Women did not give up handweaving for more genteel activities but integrated them with their market activity.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;New Brunswick",

"title": "Manufacturing paradise: tourism, development and mythmaking on Prince Edward Island 1939-1973","date": "2004","creator": "McRae, Matthew John","description": "Tourism is today Prince Edward Island’s second-largest industry and an integral part of Island society. Despite the industry's current importance, Island historians have generally neglected the study of tourism’s development in the twentieth century. Those who have given Island tourism scholarly attention have often downplayed its historical importance. This thesis argues that tourism played a transformative role in the history of twentieth-century Prince Edward Island, particularly in the post war era. Tourism growth on twentieth century Prince Edward Island largely occurred as a result of external factors, such as the development of the automobile as a reliable and affordable means of travel and the ever-increasing affluence and mobility of post Second World War North Americans. Some members of the Island’s political and commercial elite recognized tourism’s economic potential and tried to develop the industry. Island tourism promoters sold the Island to tourists as an anti-modern Garden of Eden while simultaneously selling tourism to the Island government as a means of attracting economic development and achieving prosperity. There was a contradiction built into this tourism strategy, however: On one hand tourism depended on the Island’s anti- modern image to attract visitors. On the other hand, this anti-modern image became ever more difficult to maintain as increasing tourism brought increasing progress and development. The rate of tourist development increased sharply as the federal government became involved in resolving the issue of regional economic disparity. Island tourism promoters used Charlottetown’s status as ‘the birthplace of Confederation to sell tourism to the federal government as an economic development tool. Festivals were held in 1939 and 1964 to commemorate the Island’s birthplace status. The success of these celebrations helped engender a spirit of cooperation between the federal and provincial government. By the mid-1960s it was generally accepted by both federal and provincial government planners that tourism responded well to carefully-planned capital investments and could serve as a useful economic development tool. In 1969, when the federal and provincial government signed the Comprehensive Development Plan, a fifteen-year scheme designed to modernize the Island's economy and society, tourism was a central plank in the Plan and received unprecedented funding from both Ottawa and Charlottetown. The Plan’s modernizing message could not be reconciled with tourism’s promotion of an anti-modern paradise, however. Some Islanders began to scrutinize their province’s anti-modern mythology and question the desirability of tourist development. When yet another celebration was held in 1973 1o commemorate the 100™ anniversary of Island joining Confederation, it became the stage for a debate between competing visions of Prince Edward Island society, and the role tourism had come to play in that society.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Prince Edward Island",

Maynard’s founding of Westfield College in 1882 is noteworthy because it afforded women new opportunities to gain Bachelor’s degrees from the University of London. When Maynard retired from Westfield in 1913, women had entered professional careers like teaching and medicine. This study, based on my reading of Maynard’s unpublished Green-book (1866-1935), Diary (1871-1935) and Autobiography (1915-27), together with her published texts, is a descriptive and interpretive biography of her public and private life experiences as an educational pioneer. Scholars have made recent revelations about how religion influenced women’s self-empowerment and social gains. However, little has been written about the impacts of faith and ambition on Victorian women’s passion, in general, and in particular, on those who suppressed desire to embrace suffering as evidence of moral purity. This study offers a preliminary analysis of the unique way in which one Victorian woman sought to reconcile faith, passion and ambition. It traces Maynard’s conflicts between ambition and religious duty, and between rationalism and religious passion. I am also interested in defining and exploring Maynard’s sexuality and in connecting it to her religious belief. In so doing, I hope to offer more insight into Victorian sexuality.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Britain;London",

This is a case study of how a government created an intelligence organization during war and how it subsequently revised this structure after the war. The core of the thesis focuses on the contribution of intelligence to the war effort and how war-time experiences were adapted to a postwar mandate. The relationships between the intelligence entities within the Department of National Defence and the Department of External Affairs are explored and the study records how National Defence ceded control of foreign intelligence to External Affairs in the postwar period. The thesis asks whether a Canadian interdepartmental vision of foreign intelligence existed, whether there was clear political commitment to the creation of foreign intelligence bodies, and, following World War II, whether policy-makers possessed a clear vision of the desired foreign intelligence capacity. The thesis demonstrates that the government was not actively engaged in creating the wartime intelligence structures and only partly so when restructuring foreign intelligence in the early postwar period. Canada committed sufficient resources to gain access to pooled allied intelligence but stopped short of creating a clandestine service because Canada’s political leaders were risk adverse, parochial in outlook, and did not conclude that a clandestine intelligence service was imperative to meet national foreign intelligence requirements. This decision defined perceptions of Canada’s intelligence efforts among its allies. The question arises as to whether Canada’s foreign intelligence community was autonomous. The postwar alliance which Canada entered into with the other Anglo- Saxon powers was unequal. While Canada’s foreign intelligence community was autonomous, it was also interdependent with its partners. Canada’s foreign intelligence collection efforts, limited as they were, ensured access to the intelligence gathered collectively by the alliance. As such, Canada’s foreign intelligence activities met a national objective and reflected an articulation of sovereignty. By the early 1950s, Canada possessed foreign intelligence resources which rivaled or exceeded those of many nations. Canada could task, collect, collate, evaluate, and disseminate foreign intelligence in sufficient quantity and quality to meet its national requirements.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

Despite the impressive amount of scholarship on immigration and cthnicity that appeared in Canada during the last decades, labour migration from Russia’s western frontier has failed to attract the attention of historians. Drawing on previously untapped or little used archival and published sources, this dissertation challenges traditional assumptions about emigration from the Russian Empire, which view it as consisting primarily of religious and political refugees, and demonstrates that Ukrainian and Belarusan peasant-workers constituted a substantial share of immigrants from the empire’s western frontier. This study utilizes a systems approach to migration, attempting 1o integrate the New- and the Old-World contexts in which the transoceanic moves of Ukrainian and Belarusan peasants occurred. The migrants are traced all the way from their points of origin in Russia’s western provinces to their transformation into industrial workers and residents of Canadian resource frontier and urban neighbourhoods. Focussing on two neighbouring regions of the Russian Empire, the dissertation contributes to a better and more detailed understanding of the source areas, spatial trajectories, social structure and ethnic composition of early twentieth-century Canadian immigration from Eastern Europe. A comparative analysis of migration from these regions aims at illuminating the similarities and differences in the configuration of migrant flows that connected various parts of the European continent with Canada.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Russia;Ukraine;Belarus",

The meanings associated with local, national and imperial identities served an important commercial purpose in their capacity to stimulate consumer interest, but their cultural value transcended their function in the marketplace. In representing local, national and imperial spaces, advertisements reflected broader currents of understanding about society. Most significantly, these images highlight the importance of spatial representation in the construction of identity in turn-of-the-century Canada.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

This study utilises a selection of visual and textual sources from popularly circulated comic publications. I emphasise throughout that visual and textual sources are equal communicators in (re)presenting cultural meanings, and in so doing, challenge the textist approach to the study of Victorian society. While historians recognise the importance of visual sources, images are too often given secondary consideration. Similarly, although historians use comic sources few consider how humour functioned in historical periods. By considering the convergence of class, gender, and humour in cartoons and satire, this thesis uniquely contributes to the study of Victorian popular culture and demonstrates the validity of humour in the studying of the past.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Britain",

The 1954 Geneva Conference (co-chaired by Britain and the Soviet Union) ended French colonial rule in Indochina, and Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam emerged as independent countries. Three International Commissions for Supervision and Control (ICSC) would oversee the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the new states. The Co-Chairmen, as a consequence of a suggestion by the Chinese, invited Canada, along with India and Poland, to be a member of each of the ICSCs. The Laos ICSC adjourned in 1958. It was reactivated in 1961 and ended in 1975. It is that ICSC, and Canada’s part in it, which is the subject of this inquiry. This thesis focuses on Canada’s motives, objectives and behaviour while a member of the Laos ICSC between 1954 and 1975. It provides an opportunity to evaluate the validity of the points of view put forward by the complicity and constraint schools on Canadian performance in Indochina. The thesis’s central argument is that Canada’s participation in the Laos ICSC represented a genuine attempt to be a serious internationalist within the boundaries of the Geneva framework. For almost twenty years, Canada, despite many frustrations, carried on in the tradition of the quiet, flexible and committed diplomatist. In the end, however, the ICSC had little or no positive effect on the most crucial issues: Laotian territorial integrity, the Royal Lao Government’s sovereignty and the re-integration of the Lao communists, the Pathet Lao, into Laotian national political life. The ICSC became more and more of an observer, unable to provide protection or ensure peace.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Laos",

To do this, the Borden govemment appointed a Food Controller in June 1917, whose duties were fo regulate the Canadian food supply in the hopes of realizing as large a surplus of exportable foods as possible. ‘The first Food Controller, William J. Hanna, encountered St resistance from a public struggling with ever-mounting food prices and the cost of living. They believed that the govemment's first duty lay with Canadians, rather than British consumers. Hanna's inability to secure the full cooperation of Canadians (largely due o his refusal to control prices), along with the worsening of food conditions overseas, led to the establishment of the Canada Food Board in February 1918. This agency, headed by Henry B. Thomson, was larger and in the end far more successful in obtaining public support. This success was partly due to the ‘government's realization that old methods, grounded in non-interventionist economic models, were 0 longer an effective response (0 the demands of war. The Food Board reflected this shift in atiitude by passing stricter regulations that relied more on compulsion. While the Food Board did not enact price controls to any great extent, its ubiquitous propaganda and insistence on food service as a moral duty tended to drown out the voices calling for stricter state economic regulations. Food control was hampered by the nature of the food system itself, which had developed into an intricate web of frequently contending groups, with producers, dealers, and now consumers all seeking o safeguard their own interests. Canada’s food controllers had to balance these narrower interests against the much broader concern of winning the war. Drawing on the rich collections of the National Archives of Canada and contemporary periodical literature, ths thesis argues that the goals of wartime food regulation in Canada ran contrary o these narrower concems, and demonstrates that state intervention, especially one without previous models o draw upon, can be a fundamentally unpredictable process, and one whose results can depend upon the successful balancing of competing intcrests. While food regulation may have grown out of a straightforward desire to mobilize Canada’s food resources in the service of war, it also constituted an important and innovative foray by the state into the daily lives of Canadians.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

An international assistance effort was mounted because all government in Somalia had collapsed, and the country was being ravaged by a mass famine, civil war and drought.

This thesis is a re-examination of the Niitsitapi trade, to the 1830s, principally with the North West and Hudson’s Bay companies, and later with American concerns. A more rigorous examination of the documentary record and an understanding of Niitsitapi cultural and religious beliefs permit new interpretations of some key issues in their history. There was no Niitsitapi trade at York Factory in the 18th century, nor was there an Archithinue (a term that included the Niitsitapi and several other First Nations peoples) trade there either. There is insufficient evidence to support the contention of an 18th-century Niitsitapi-Cree trade and military alliance. The Niitsitapi initially refused to kill beaver for the trade because of their belief systems; only after the Hudson’s Bay Company merger of 1821 and a drastic devaluation of wolf pelts did one of the three Niitsitapi peoples (the Piikani) enter the beaver trade, driven to protect their national interests in a 19th-century arms race with neighbouring enemies. Conflict with Americans resulted in part from the American failure to adapt to Niitsitapi protocols of external relations, and in part because the Americans came to Niitsitapi country as hunters and trappers, rather than as traders. Only when ex-North West and Hudson's Bay company employees joined the Missouri River trade did American attitudes change. After 1831, the bulk of the Niitsitapi trade was lost to the British. However, the American demand for and capacity to carry buffalo robes allowed the Piikani to stop killing beaver and to meet their needs through the robe trade. The three Niitsitapi peoples rationally assessed the particular approaches and practices of the three groups of Euroamerican newcomers, recognized the obstacles and opportunities presented in each set of circumstances, and then showed remarkable flexibility in the actions which they took to ensure their survival and prosperity.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

"title": "The Canadian War Museums art collections as a site of meaning, memory, and identity in the twentieth century","date": "2002","creator": "Brandon, Laura","description": "‘The Canadian War Museum (CWM) has custody of one of the finest twentieth- century official war art collections in the world. Given this fact, it has until recently received limited attention and is relatively unknown. In the context of recent publications dealing with issues of memory and identity, the ten studies that comprise this dissertation examine some of the reasons why this might have been the case. They explore the worth of the art in the context of ts historical and cultural meaning. As well, they examine the outside activity that has surrounded the collections’ history beginning with the First World War and ending with the announcement of a new war art nitiative by the Department of National Defence (DND) in June 2001 ‘The overarching theoretical underpinning to this dissertation is largely concemned with the construction of social memory in relation to the creation of identity. Significantly important to the analysis is the corollary of remembering, “forgetting.” The Canadian War Museum, as the single largest repository of official war art, provides 2 particularly fruitful place to explore the place of forgetting in the construction of memory, as the collections remain, with very few exceptions, intact. It is thus possible to examine what was forgotten as well as what now forms the official artistic memory of war in Canada. The thesis argues that the history of the war art collections in Canada cannot be divorced from the political, institutional, social, and cultural milieu in which the art had its origins. Its ebbs and flows within the Canadian consciousness over time, it is posited, involve both active encouragement and active discouragement. Specifically, it is suggested that aesthetic considerations as to the worth of war art are secondary by far to its value, or lack of value, to varying interest groups at different times. Furthermore, when aesthetic value is assigned to certain works of art, artists, or styles these come about as a result of contextual pressures and not as a result of successful war art exhibition Canvas of War: Masterpieces from the Canadian War Museum as its starting point, this dissertation examines how a show produced by 2 ‘national public institution can, given a particular set of circumstances — in this case the 50th Anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1995 - move from being a display of 2 little-known collection of publicly-owned art to one that can assume a role as a site of memory.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Ottawa;Canadian War Museum",

"title": "I could not bear to be beaten by difficulties : Exploring David Livingstone and questions of manliness, race and colonialism in ninetheenth-century Africa and Britain","date": "2002","creator": "Petrusic, Christopher G.","description": "My dissertation, “/ could not bear to be beaten by difficulties’: Exploring David 3 Livingstone and Questions of Manliness, Race and Colonialism in Nineteenth-Century 3 Africa and Britain,” examines the complex relationship between gender, race and imperialism. The missionary-explorer David Livingstone (1813-1873) was one of the most celebrated heroes of the British empire. However, his unconventional conception of African manliness and his radical racial politics have long been buried in a potent myth that has obscured his view of Africans, empire and manliness. This study demonstrates that Livingstone’s idea of what it meant to be manly was at odds with imperialism’s dominant racial and gender stereotypes. Critical of the racial intolerance of his compatriots, Livingstone maintained that manliness was not the exclusive dominion of white men, as it was for most other nineteenth century Britons. He held the unorthodox view that African men could demonstrate manliness on a par with any other ‘race’ of men, whether they were members of his crew or working in pursuit of their own goals. Although Livingstone was not free from racial intolerance, among Victorians his attitudes towards Africans were radical ‘ and they separated him from most of his contemporaries. By comparing his racial attitudes 3 with those of his compatriots, I show that his conception of ‘race’ challenged orthodox Victorian opinion about the ‘nature’ of Africans and African society in a number of complex and distinctive ways. Throughout his writings, Livingstone asserted that all Africans had the inherent capacity to ‘rise’ to the level of the most ‘civilized’ societies. During his thirty years in Africa, this belief motivated, in part, his support for the anti-colonial struggles of the Xhosa and Khoikhoi peoples against British exploitation in the Cape Colony.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Britain;Africa",

During the ensuing civil disorder, Belgium invaded to secure the safety of nationals who had decided to remain. Many in the international community condemned Belgium, and the Congolese leadership formally requested assistance from the United Nations. In response, the UN established the Opération des Nations Unies au Congo [ONUC or 1 UNOC], initially to restore order and to supervise the withdrawal of all foreign nationals from Congolese teitory. ] This dissertation, the first thorough examination of Canada’s foreign policy during the Congo crisis and its participation in ONUC, uses primary sources to recount and assess significant issues and events. A number of themes are addressed the politics of decolonisation in the Canadian and international responses to the collapse of ‘order\" within the Congo, and Canadian efforts to bridge political differences between developed and developing nations; the impact of the Cold War on Canadian and UN involvement in the Congo the increasingly interventionist nature of ONUC's mandate and official views on the use of force; the inter- and intra-departmental dynamics of Canada’s peacekeeping policy development; and the motivations and objectives behind Canadian participation in ONUC. Canada’s Congo policy, under the Conservative government of John Diefenbaker and then Lester Pearson’s Liberal government, attempted to balance a number of, sometimes competing, considerations. As a NATO ally, Canada’s llegiance t the West was clear; yet officials attempted to maintain an overall impression of objectivity. Canadian policy attempted to avoid any positions that could alienate the growing number of Afro-Asian members of the UN. The views of many of the non-aligned states differed from that of Canada on one significant issue ONUC's use of force. Ottawa consistently opposed any attempt by the UN to use ONUC to force a political settlement in the Congo. This opposition was voiced quietly 1o the Secretary-General and senior members of the Secretariat. Canadian policy with respect to ONUC and the Congo crisis was driven by a number of pragmatic factors, the paramount of which was support of the United Nations and its peacekeeping role.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;The Congo",

It describes the structure of the army school system. the motives of its providers, and the intricacies of its policies. The work examines the reasons why British authorities were compelled to recognize the concept of schooling for the rank and file as well as their children. Educational reforms remained in the forefront of social reform within the army and, as such, stimulated much debate. Although the motivation was initially operational and humanitarian, schools were increasingly viewed by army policy makers and administrators as an instrument of socialization. For whatever reason. the military established schools for soldiers and their children well in advance of their civilian contemporarics. The analysis also examines whether Canada's unique ‘geographic location affected the British government's attitude towards education and family inthe military. Through examination of the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment. a special unit raised 10 deal with problems of garrison duty in British North America. the thesis reveals that schools became an increasingly significant facet of garrison lif, demanding more and more of the administration’s attention and resources. The study also shows that the detached nature of military duties associated with these units fostered an increasingly dysfunctional education system within Canadian garrisons, foreshadowing a general decline in the quality of schooling for all children of the British military towards the end of the century.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

This thesis will examine the role that the Sisters played in shaping the network of social and religious services in the area. In doing so it attempts to fill a gap in our historical knowledge. A number of the Sisters were Irish female immigrants and played an active role in the Order. There has been a lack of attention to the female members of the Irish diaspora in Canada and the degree to which they displayed agency and helped to shape the emerging Canadian society. Although these women were members of a highly structured religious congregation, they worked within the system to carve out successful and satisfying careers. Their faith was central to their lives and they were inspired by the overwhelming urge to find their salvation by social action. The Sisters’ spirituality cannot be separated from their lives and work. It allowed them to persist in overcoming the hardships and poverty of life in the convent and sustained them in their struggle to succeed in their mission in Bytown. The Sisters were actively involved in organizations which had a direct impact on the newly emerging city of Ottawa. By using records housed in the religious archives of the Sisters of Charity of Ottawa and the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate, this thesis attempts to explore how the Sisters negotiated issues relating to gender, class, ethnicity, and religion as they worked to build their institutions.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Ottawa",

Throughout their journey to Canada, and even after their arrival, war brides came into contact with government bodies like the Canadian Wives’ Bureau, as well as voluntary organizations. These groups were instruments of education and acculturation and focused their ‘Canadianization’ lessons on war brides’ roles as wives, mothers, and consumers. War brides continually negotiated and selected messages in order to make use of tools that would suit their own needs. They did this, for example, through the War Brides’ Clubs they organized in Canada. This thesis uses records of the Department of Mines and Resources, Immigration Branch, Department of National Defence, records of various voluntary organizations, as well as the oral histories of British war brides to investigate aspects of gender, consumerism, citizenship, and “Britishness” in the stories of war brides.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

Their recollections of childhood and education are examined to determine the origin of ideologies and values that guided them through their adult years. Grand ducal roles are observed to determine if they had any influence on the Tsar. The Romanovs’ recollections of the important personages of their time, and of their experiences of revolution, are documented. Their opinions of the USSR and their visions of Russia’s post-Soviet future are also explored. The study reveals the Romanovs were well- meaning, but not educated in a fashion enabling them to govern effectively; they were out of touch with Russia's needs and in any case, the grand ducal role was impotent. Despite the revolutions and their forced exile, the Romanovs maintained an essentially autocratic outlook concerning Russia.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Russia;USSR;Europe",

These modifications and the conflict they engendered were shaped by discourses produced within a vast print marketplace of pamphlets, sermons, treatises and newsbooks. In studying the tracts of this period, this work has isolated the moral debate on ‘the Leveller’ and the debate’s interrelation to the practices of a ‘sort of men’ who formed a political organization to pursue a specific set of goals and ideals. Central to the practices of this organization was the promotion of an Agreement of the People as a model for settling the commonwealth. The examination of this group is organized by a Foucaultian methodology, whereby it analyses the way an ethical experience of engagement produced, within ‘practices of the self,” the conditions for the leveller to constitute himself as an ethical subject of his political activity. Organizing the thesis within a different theoretical paradigm has enabled it to suggest the way the leveller introduced important changes to modes of political subjectivity based upon a problematization of the ‘self” in ethical practice.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "England",

P.","description": "This study examines the introduction, persistence and eventual public rejection of Christian education in Ontario’s public schools during the period of 1944-1969. This episode reveals a significant shift in the political and religious culture of Ontario in the two decades after the Second World War. During this time period the traditional British, Protestant, conservative culture of “Old Ontario” gradually gave way to a more pluralistic, liberal culture. The religious education program was introduced into the schools in reaction to these changes. in an effort to bolster a fading worldview, but because the program was so closely tied to a traditional culture which came under increasing criticism in the 1960s, it was swept away as a cultural anachronism. Controversy and public debate arose when the program was introduced in 1944 and again during the carly 1960s. A comparison of the public debates in these two periods provides ample evidence of the significant shift in attitudes which had taken place. The study concludes that in this episode, which at first glance does not appear to fit into most theories of secularization and modemnization, the state increased the presence of religion in the public sphere. supposedly taking over the role of churches and teaching the Christian religion as a means to fortify a common political culture. In the turmoil of the Second World War, and in the conservative-modemism of the 1950s, such a program was not objectionable to most members of society, although opposition was strong from religious minorities. When more liberal ideas about individual rights and pluralism began to gain authority in the culture. the previous practices were denounced as indoctrinating, oppressive and segregationist. The program had not changed significantly. nor had the religious demographics of public school attendees. The public controversy and rejection was a symptom of a much deeper cultural change. As democratic citizenship was redefined in liberal terms. Christianity was relegated to the private sphere. losing its privileged status as public religion in a conservative culture.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada;Ontario",

"title": "Canadas Polymer Corporation : the crown, technological innovation, and the pursuit of economic interest, 1942-1990","date": "2001","creator": "Bellamy, Matthew J.","description": "Crown corporations are widely regarded as a quintessentially-Canadian invention. Since 1841, they have been dexterously implemented and hotly debated as instruments of public policy. This is the history of the birth and evolution of one such crown corporation - Canada’s leading synthetic rubber producer - and the play of public policy and commercial enterprise upon it. Rubber has been an indispensable ingredient of modem industry; its malleable properties minimize the wear and tear of mechanical existence. When the Japanese military poured into Southeast Asia in December, 1941, cutting off the Allies’ supply of natural rubber, Ottawa’s response was to create a crown company, Polymer Corporation Ltd., to oversee the construction and operation of a synthetic rubber plant at Sarnia, Ontario. During the war, Polymer met all of Canada’s rubber needs. After the war, it became a model of state-owned industrial success. How it did so is the subject of this work. In Canada, crown corporations have always been expected to perform - albeit somewhat paradoxically - both policy and commercial roles. Polymer was unique in that, for most of its existence, the emphasis was on the latter function. Making money was its raison d’étre. In the process of turning a profit, however, Polymer incidentally served a public purpose - initially winning the war and latterly giving Canada a leading-edge presence in the global synthetic rubber industry. Given Polymer’s duality of function, this thesis proceeds on two levels. At one level it explores the politics of public enterprise by focusing on developments at Polymer from its inception in 1942 to the time of its purchase by the German-owned A.G. Bayer company in 1990. The questions which are explored here include: the rationale for establishing Polymer; Polymer’s changing role as an instrument of policy and the extent to which it fulfilled its mission; the standards to which Polymer was held accountable; and the politics of multi-nationalization and privatization. On another level this dissertation examines the growth of a firm. It investigates how this unique corporation managed to expand and prosper. It seeks to identify the challenges which Polymer faced as a commercial enterprise and its response to those challenges. It explores Polymer’s strategies and structures in the context of intemational business developments; the role of science and technology in the growth of the firm; the relationship between profits and innovation; and the dynamics of corporate decision making. Drawing on the rich Polymer collection at the National Archives of Canada and the informed comments and reflections of the men who led the corporation over a period of fifty years, the thesis concludes, that contrary to neo-conservative rhetoric, crown corporations can be borh effective instruments of public policy and dynamic and profitable commercial enterprises.","subject": "Industrial development; Rubber; World War 1939-1945","location": "Canada; Ontario; Sarnia",

By the 1920s, evangelistic healing campaigns in large urban centres were drawing tens of thousands on a daily basis. This work traces the development o.f divine healing within Canadian Protestantism by examining a wide variety of groups that engaged in the practice, including the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the Salvation Army, the Christian Catholic Church, and Pentecostalism. It also analyzes the diverse reactions to divine healing on the part of fundamentalists, mainline Protestants, the medical community, and the state. By framing the phenomenon of divine healing as a history of the body, this dissertation presents a unique perspective on the multiple ways in which medical and religious discourses competed in their constructions of the body. Proponents of faith healing subverted the epistemological grounding of medical knowledge by turning insiead to the personal subjective experience of religion as the authoritative basis to lay claim to “divine health.” The social space in which faith healing took place was transformed over time, but the dominating presence of women remained a constant feature from the beginning. ‘This study explores the cultural practice of faith healing as both a devotional observance and a point of resistance to conventional medicine. It is argued that the act of healing took place within a matrix of religious and medical ideologies that were in turn enwrapped by constructions of gender, class, and social geography. By disentangling these complex layers of meaning, faith healing is historically situated as a particular way of viewing, and understanding, the body.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "Canada",

"title": "Writing out of orthodoxy: Lily Dougall, Anglican modernist, 1858-1923","date": "1999","creator": "Dean, Joanna","description": "Lily Dougall (1858-1923) was a Canadian novelist and religious essayist. This biography charts her intellectual development from her evangelical youth in Montreal and New York to her prominence as a religious speaker and writer with the Anglican Modernist movement in Oxford, England. It is an investigation into the gendered cultural context within which modern experiential faith has developed. Lily Dougall was known in Britain for her thought-provoking novels, such as Beggars All (1891), when she published, anonymously, the controversial lyrical religious essay, Pro Christo et Ecclesia (1900). Between 1900 and 1923 she wrote and edited a series of widely read works of modern theology, and became a popular modernist speaker, an advocate of spiritual healing through the Guild of Heaith, and a mentor to the Student Christian Movement and the Anglican Fellowship. With Canon B.H. Streeter, she created the Cumnor Group, an influential discussion group dedicated to liberal theology. As a religious modernist, Lily Dougall advocated free intellectual inquiry and rejected the traditional authorities of creed, doctrine and the Bible. She did not find miracles, even the miracles of the virein birth and phvsical resurrection of Christ, central to her faith. Instead her theology was experiential, based on the personal experience of God. The thesis identifies the origins of this liberal and experiential faith in the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Thomas Carlyle, F.D. Maurice, and American holiness theologian Thomas Upham, and describes the evolution of her religious thought through evangelicalism, the Anglican Broad Church, Christian socialism, personal idealism, modernism and Christian fellowship. The thesis argues for a more contextual and historically nuanced understanding of religious experience. It analyses the gendered nature of liberal spirituality, which shaped, and sometimes silenced, women’s theological expression, and discusses Dougall’s difficulties entering and working within the masculine world of theology. Finally, it examines the links between Edwardian experiential faith and the development of feminist theology, the modern study of mysticism, and the early science of psychology.","subject": "Dougall, Lily, 1858-1923 ;Criticism And Interpretation; Liberalism (Religion);Feminist Theology","location": "Canada;Montreal;US;New York;Oxford;England",

"title": "Education and assimilation in the Lakehead, 1900-1939","date": "1995","creator": "Dixon, Lydia Janice Elizabeth","description": "Through a case study of the Lakehead, this thesis explores whether the provincial school system, with its Anglo-conformity approach to assimilation, was as important or exclusive an influence as Ontario education officials hoped and claimed in assimilating \"foreigners\" in the Lakehead between 1900 and 1939. The urban and rural areas of Port Arthur and Fort William, which experienced rapid population growth and changes in ethnic composition mainly due to heavy immigration of entrance status immigrants between 1900 and 1930, provided an excellent setting for the study of education and assimilation. The Lakehead's isolation and distance from central Ontario and limited financial and human resources of school boards, coupled with the rapid growth of the Lakehead's population with its particular socioeconomic and ethnic composition, shaped the development of provincial school education locally. These factors appeared to modify the original objectives stated by education officials to create a \"homogeneous citizenship\" through programs to achieve Anglo-conformity. The provincial school system was neither the only nor necessarily the most important influence on the assimilation process in the Lakehead between 1900 and 1939. Other agencies, which included religious, social, and political organizations sponsored by Canadians and immigrants of charter groups as well as entrance status immigrants, also played an important role in educating immigrants and shaping the assimilation process. Moreover, the role of these agencies changed throughout the period from 1900 to 1939.","subject": "Immigrants ; Education ; Ontario, Northern; Cross-cultural Studies; Children Of Immigrants ; Minorities ; Cultural pluralism","location": "Canada;Ontario",

In numerous letters, telegrams and memorandums, they advocated the introduction of full-scale rearmament, and the formation of closer ties with France, Italy and the Soviet Union, to combat the German menace.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "tbd",

Chapter II considers the response of Isabella and Mortimer to political dissension within the realm and the threat of invasion from Scotland. The impact of the policy of accommodation upon the local risings is discussed. Chapter III looks at the involvement of the central authority in preparing for war and in conducting the northern campaigns between April and October 1327. The origins and events of the Abingdon rising are studied. Governmental reaction to renewed violence at Bury is examined. Chapter IV studies the functioning of the judicial process at Bury from October 1527 till May 1328. The efforts of the central government to secure convictions against the accused and the attendant response of the local inhabitants are discussed. Chapter V provides a quantitative analysis of the social and economic status of the Bury rebels based upon a comparative study of the record of the oyer et terminer proceedings and the Suffolk subsidy roll for 1327. The importance of lordship, geographical location, wealth and occupation as determinants of proclivity to revolt are considered.","subject": "not yet catalogued","location": "tbd",

Indeed before the colony was a decade old there were nearly a score of identifiable schools established, some with more longevity than others. These schools were varied: some were run by ministers of the Church of England, by loyalists, by Presbyterians, by Baptists, by Moravians and by men who had failed at other employment, and by 1804 the Catholics were demanding their own. There was a classical school, a school for Mohawks and a school for orphans. These schools, however varied, strove for a basic goal. It was their intent to promote loyalty, morality and Christianity in the colony. This striving for morality was in the old Puritan sense. They were not to give the people charity, alms, but to promote man himself. The man was to be made aware of his usefulness and this would prevent sloth and excess. Poverty and idleness led to crime, freethinking and disloyality.","subject": "Education ;Ontario ; History 1791-1841Ontario ; 1791-1841Strachan, John, ; 1778-1867","location": "tbd",

The ambassadors of the 1920's and 1930's displayed a general continuity of interpretationand advice, expressing consistent support for a policy of appeasing German desires. These diplomats saw German society as unstable and given to outbreaks of extremism, but in the long run amenable to conciliatory treatment, since the governing elite was predominantly moderate and responsable. This moderate element was,in the eyes of the ambassadors, trustworthy and could be strengthened by timely British gestures and concessions. The advent of Hitler altered the picture only in that the threat of extremist elements became more immediate. Nazi ambitions were increasingly seen as legitimate, as one ambassedor succeeded another, and Hitler was portrayed as a moderate within the Third Reich. This coincided with a continuing decline in the ambassadors' relations with German leaders and officials and in the quality of their sources of information. Nevertheless, the British representatives also described the risks of an appeasement policy and the need for caution and the development of British strength while executing this policy. On the whole, the despatches of the ambassadors suggest that any divergence of views between them and the British government has been exaggerated.","subject": "Great Britain ;Foreign Relations ;Germany ;Great Britain ;Foreign Relations 1910-1936Germany ;Foreign Relations ;Great Britain ; Diplomats ;Great Britain","location": "Britain;Germany",

Sonification is the \"visualization\" of historical data auditorially, to achieve a particular sensory affect. This project asks readers and listeners to hear uncanny, affective pasts and consider the ways in which storytellers can \"de- form\" and \"re-form\" data and sources. The three \"songs of the Ottawa\" offer a way into the stories of the river’s flows, of commerce and industry extending up and downstream, and of recreation on the water and shores.","subject": "Industry; Sonification; Environment; Ottawa River; Ottawa; Public History","location": "Canada;Ottawa",

This journal is instrumental for defining the field and showing how its goals may have changed over time. By using large-scale computational text analysis, I can trace how public history has evolved. In particular, I have identified that the journal’s early publications discussed training historians for the workplace. Secondarily, public history sought to reconcile the differences between community historians and the history of the academy. By analyzing the entire corpus of the journal The Public Historian with large-scale computational text analysis I can demonstrate that there are two periods in the field’s history which reflect those separate goals, with the earlier three decades reflecting the employment directive, and the latter two reflecting a change in focus.","subject": "Public History;Text Analysis;Historiography; Public History","location": "Canada;US",

Whether cartridge, magnetic tape, floppy disk, they degrade. Without care and study, they die and cannot be played again. While it might be possible to resurrect play using emulation or video captures, scholars need to consider every option at their disposal to preserve videogames for future study. This includes securing original versions of games and ephemera; recording play; interviewing game creators and players; and much more. This project develops a new approach to conceptualise video games as material and cultural heritage, and proposes a methodology for the study of older video games, especially those for which there is no original version left (e.g. “dead” games). Once dead, games can only be experienced though what this project describes as deadplay, or playing dead games. This essay reflects on the project’s theoretical foundation, positions it in the Public History field, and explores the use of podcasting as a medium to communicate this.","subject": "Public History; Video Games; Conservation; Media Studies; Public History","location": "Canada;US",

What would make it good public history, what needs to be included for it to make a pedagogical argument? This major research project is an experiment in creating a game design document (GDD) for a public history game called Remember Us, a game centred around the experiences of immigrants and the working class in 1898 Ontario. This experiment takes the form of a GDD. A GDD is a roadmap for developers to follow when making games and is just as integral to the game as the narrative. This essay describes what a GDD is, the process of making one, and how its narrative and game mechanics intersect with historiography. This essay sets the scene for exploring the GDD. This essay also challenges readers to think differently about games and their potential for public history: Games have the power to not only bring something new to the discipline, but to give players and readers a memorable experience that challenges them to think in new, participatory ways outside the traditional forms of academic study.","subject": "Video games;Historiography;Representation;Interpretation;Design;Historical Empathy","location": "Canada;Ontario",

"title": "Networks of Commemoration: Gender, Class, and the Remembrance of General Brock, 1898-192","date": "2013","creator": "Holdsworth, Peter William","description": "On 19 August1912, the General Brock Chapter of the Imperial Order Daughters of The Empire unveiled a monument to General Sir Isaac Brock in the town of Brockville, Ontario. This monument represented just part of the efforts of a network of upper-class Anglo-Saxon women from the IODE, United Empire Loyalists of Ontario, and Ontario Historical Society to celebrate the centenary of the War of 1812 as the “Brock Centenary.” The context of the rise of the “Brock Centenary” is investigated here by applying social network theory to historical memory studies,re-interpreting historical evidence from 1898 to 1912. An analysis of membership lists both reaffirms some previous arguments and points to promising avenues of inquiry regarding the importance and influence of the groups and women involved. While focusing on the Brock Centenary, this study also suggests further use of social network analysis for historical memory studies and heritage organizations","subject": "Commemoration;Social Network Analysis;Public History;United Empire Loyalists;Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire;Isaac Brock","location": "Canada;Brockville;Niagara",
